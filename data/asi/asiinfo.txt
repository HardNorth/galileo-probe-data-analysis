This file describes the data obtained by the Galileo Probe Atmosphere         
Structure Instrument during the entry and descent into the Jupiter atmosphere 
on December 7, 1995. The total time of data acquisition was less than two     
hours before the destruction of the probe in the Jupiter atmosphere.

This file contains reduced data for the Galileo Probe Atmospheric Structure   
Instrument, including time from minor frame 0, altitude, pressure,            
temperature, atmospheric density, gravitational acceleration, descent         
velocity, and temperature gradient for the descend phase. These profiles are  
not a list of measured points, but is derived using the dry adiabat which     
fits the data, as shown and described in SEIFFETAL1998.                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Data in the following files d04p1.dat, d04p2.dat and d04p3.dat, contain       
data for all of the Descent sequence pressure sensor measurements. The data   
in file d04p1 contains all data from the 0 to 500 mb range sensor. The data   
in file d04p2 contains all data from the 0 to 4 b range sensor. The data      
in file d04p3 contains all data from the 0 to 28 b range sensor.              
                                                                              
A correction (reduction in pressure) needs to be made for the ram effect      
of the probe moving through the atmosphere for each set of pressure sensor    
data.  The magnitude of this correction depends upon the velocity profile     
developed by modeling the descent. For one modeling approach the correction   
is about -5mb for the bulk of descent, with some modest variations during     
the first 100 seconds which reach a peak of about -7.8 mb at 80 sec.
