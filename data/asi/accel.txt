Data in these files, e03z1.dat, e03z2.dat, e03an.dat, contain data            
for all of the Entry sequence acceleration measurements. The data in          
file asi_z1 contains all data from the primary axial sensor. The data         
in file asi_z2 contains all data from the secondary axial sensor. The         
data in file asi_an contains all data from the lateral sensors.               
                                                                              
Descriptions of the instrumentation can be found in Space Sciences

For files asi_z1 and asi_z2 the first column in each file identifies the      
measurement sample time, and the second column provides the measured          
acceleration in m/sec/sec at the sample time.                                 
                                                                              
Each of the axial sensors operated in four measurement ranges:                
                                                                              
1)  0 to 0.123 m/sec/sec with a resolution of approximately 3.0x10^(-5)       
m/sec/sec per count,                                                          
2)  0 to 3.92 m/sec/sec with a resolution of approximately 0.00096 m/sec/sec  
per count,                                                                    
3)  -62.7 to +62.7 m/sec/sec with a resolution of approximately 0.0306        
m/sec/sec per count,                                                          
4)  0 to 4016 m/sec/sec with a resolution of approximately 0.98               
m/sec/sec per count,                                                          
                                                                              
Data from the Mission Sequence Test indicates that the Axial sensors do       
not reach full equilibrium on range 1 between the time of turn-on and         
the start of the calibration sequence. The following adjustments have         
been made prior to processing the data:                                       
                                                                              
a)  The Z1 Range 1 offset has been changed by 5.7 counts relative to          
the PEC value.                                                                
                                                                              
b)  The Z2 Range 1 offset has been changed by 7.7 counts relative to          
the PEC value.                                                                
                                                                              
c)  The Z1 reference temperature at the start of entry has been set to        
0.346 deg C                                                                   
                                                                              
d)  The Z2 reference temperature at the start of entry has been set to        
0.205 deg C                                                                   
                                                                              
Accelerometer range changes were not tied to sampling times;                  
consequently it was possible for a range change to occur just before a        
sampling time. In such cases it is possible that a measurement was            
taken before settling in the new range had occurred.                          
                                                                              
e)  The value for Z1 at time -157.742 is suspect high (at a range change)     
and should probably not be used.                                              
                                                                              
f ) The value for Z2 at time -156.805 is suspect high (at a range change)     
and should possibly not be used.                                              
                                                                              
g)  The value for Z1 at time -140.867 is suspect high (at a range change)     
and should probably not be used.                                              
                                                                              
h)  The value for Z2 at time -140.555 is suspect high (at a range change)     
and should possibly not be used.                                              
                                                                              
i)  The value for Z1 at time -128.992 is suspect high (at a range change)     
and should possibly not be used.                                              
                                                                              
j)  The value for Z2 at time -129.305 is suspect high (at a range change)     
and should probably not be used.                                              
                                                                              
k)  The value for Z1 at time -62.117 is suspect low (at a range change)       
and should probably not be used.                                              
                                                                              
l)  The value for Z2 at time -62.43 is suspect low (at a range change)        
and should probably not be used.                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
For file asi_an, the first column identifies the measurement sample time,     
and the second column provides the magnitude of the resultant of the          
lateral accelerometers in m/sec/sec at the sample time.                       
                                                                              
The lateral accelerometers operated in three ranges. The magnitude of         
the resultant of the two (X and Y) lateral accelerations was computed         
for each measurement. The three nominal measurement ranges for the            
resultant were:                                                               
                                                                              
1)  -0.17 to +0.17 m/sec/sec with a resolution of approximately               
0.00068 m/sec/sec per count,                                                  
2)  -11.0 to +11.0 m/sec/sec with a resolution of approximately               
0.0435 m/sec/sec per count,                                                   
3)  -177 g to +177 m/sec/sec with a resolution of approximately               
0.696 m/sec/sec per count.
