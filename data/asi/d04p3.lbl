column 1 contains sensor sampling time in seconds after the start of the      
Descent mode (minor frame 0), column 2 contains the pressure derived from     
the steady state sensor calibrations in millibars, column 3 contains the      
correction for the rate of change of temperature effect on the sensor in      
millibars, column 4 contains the computed final pressure data in              
millibars, and column 5 contains the sensor temperature in degrees Celsius.   
Spikes in pressure data after ~2600 sec are instrument anomalies
