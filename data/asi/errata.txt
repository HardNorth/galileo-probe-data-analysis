The following files contain the raw data stream from the Galileo Probe        
Atmosphere Structure Instrument.                                              
                                                                              
The data are either for sensor, calibration or housekeeping purposes. The     
PDS archive may not have the files necessary for data reduction. However      
these data are potentially of some interest to the ASI and are reported       
informally as a part of this PDS data record. If any of these data are        
used for some formal purpose, reference should be made to the official        
probe data results report to assure accuracy of the data.
