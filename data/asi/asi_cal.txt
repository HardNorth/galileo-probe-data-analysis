1.0    Instrument Overview                                                    
==========================                                                    
                                                                              
 The Galileo Probe Atmosphere Structure Instrument was designed to make       
 in-situ measurements of the thermal structure of the Jovian atmosphere,      
 i.e., the variation of temperature, pressure and density with altitude.      
 The end objective was to improve our understanding of the local dynamics     
 and thermodynamics of the atmosphere at the probe entry site.                
                                                                              
 The specific scientific objectives were summarized at the time of the        
experiment proposal as:                                                       
                                                                              
 1. To accurately define the state properties as a function of altitude       
below the 100 mb level to an atmospheric pressure of about 20 bars.           
                                                                              
 2. To define the state properties of the upper atmosphere.                   
                                                                              
 3. To measure the stability of the atmosphere, and identify convective       
layers and stable layers, where they exist.                                   
                                                                              
 4. To detect cloud levels from changes in lapse rate at their boundaries.    
                                                                              
 5. To define state properties within the clouds, and thus provide            
supplementary information on cloud composition.                               
                                                                              
 6. To search for and characterize wave structures in the atmosphere.         
                                                                              
 7. To search for and measure intensity and scale of turbulence in the        
atmosphere.                                                                   
                                                                              
 8. To measure vertical flow velocities above a threshold of about 0.3 m/s.   
                                                                              
 9. To establish an altitude scale for use in correlating all probe           
experiment data.                                                              
                                                                              
  10. To define the probe vertical velocity, necessary to the analysis of     
the Doppler wind experiment.                                                  
                                                                              
 These objectives can be responded to by analysis of a sufficiently accurate  
set of data from sensors directly sampling the atmospheric temperature and    
pressure, and by accelerometers measuring orthogonal accelerations of the     
probe center of gravity.                                                      
                                                                              
 The Galileo experiment operated in two measurement modes, one to accommodate 
conditions of high speed entry at low ambient density (entry mode); the other,
the very different conditions of parachute descent (descent mode).  There was 
also a calibration mode which provided instrument calibration data whilst     
still in free-fall prior to entry into the Jovian atmosphere.                 
                                                                              
 The entry mode started at a nominal ambient density threshold of about       
10^(-11) kg/m^3 where the probe deceleration was about 15 micro g.  From      
measurements of probe deceleration under the action of atmospheric drag,      
atmospheric densities were derived.  The density profile was integrated above 
a given altitude to define the pressure at that level, and the temperature    
profile was then obtained through the equation of state, by use of the        
variation of atmospheric mean molecular weight with altitude we generated by  
modeling the upper atmosphere consistent with the experiment data.  At        
initial entry the Probe velocity was about 48 km/sec.  At high velocities,    
it was enveloped by a bow shock wave and a thin shock layer of ionized,       
luminescent gases at extreme temperatures (~15,000K at peak).  Under these    
conditions, measurements of the ambient atmosphere by means of conventional   
low-density sensors are not possible.  Measurements of atmospheric density by 
way of probe decelerations, however, provides a direct means of sensing the   
atmosphere ([Seiff et al, 1973], [Seiff and Kirk, 1977], [Seiff et al, 1980]).
This mode of operation continued until the parachute was deployed.            
                                                                              
 During the subsequent parachute descent of the probe to the 'end-of-mission',
the thermal structure of the atmosphere was defined by direct measurements of 
temperature, pressure, and acceleration.  After the parachute was deployed,   
the heat shield was jettisoned and temperature and pressure sensors were      
exposed to the ambient atmosphere.  Acceleration measurements were continued  
at much less frequent intervals.  In the absence of large vertical winds the  
accelerometers continued to define atmospheric density; but since other probe 
instruments defined atmospheric composition and hence molecular weight,       
density was defined by the pressure and temperature measurements.  This made  
it possible to use the accelerometer data to define the magnitude of vertical 
winds above a threshold of a few tenths of a meter/sec.                       
                                                                              
 Altitudes relative to the 1 bar level were defined by the temperature and    
pressure data integrated in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium.  These   
data were used to establish the altitudes of measurement for all probe        
experiments.  They also defined the rate of descent, necessary to the         
determination of zonal winds in the analysis of Doppler wind experiment.      
In addition, atmospheric turbulence and Probe angle of attack were sensed or  
derived.                                                                      
                                                                              
 The measurements were implemented by :                                       
                                                                              
a) Four accelerometers located as close to the center of gravity of the probe 
as was practical.  Two accelerometers (z1 and z2) measured the axial          
accelerations (for redundancy in the critical axial direction) and one sensor 
measured in each of the lateral directions (x and y).                         
                                                                              
Each of the axial sensors operated in four measurement ranges:                
                                                                              
1) 0 to 0.123 m/s/s with a resolution of approximately                        
3.0x10^(-5) m/s/s per count,                                                  
2) 0 to 3.92 m/s/s with a resolution of approximately                         
0.00096 m/s/s per count,                                                      
3) -62.7 to +62.7 m/s/s with a resolution of approximately                    
0.0306 m/s/s per count,                                                       
4) 0 to 4016 m/s/s with a resolution of approximately 0.98 m/s/s per count,   
                                                                              
 The lateral accelerometers operated in three ranges.  The magnitude of the   
resultant of the lateral accelerations was computed for each measurement.     
The three nominal measurement ranges for the resultant were:                  
                                                                              
1) -0.17 to +0.17 m/s/s with a resolution of approximately                    
0.00068 m/s/s per count,                                                      
2) -11.0 to +11.0 m/s/s with a resolution of approximately                    
0.0435 m/s/s per count,                                                       
3) -177 g to +177 m/s/s with a resolution of approximately                    
0.696 m/s/s per count.                                                        
                                                                              
Range changes were controlled by the central electronics                      
                                                                              
b) Two temperature sensors for direct sampling of the atmospheric temperature 
were exposed to the ambient atmosphere when the aeroshell was jettisoned.     
Both were platinum resistance thermometers.  One (T1) was designed to have a  
very rapid response.  This resulted in a relatively delicate sensor.  The     
second sensor (T2) was more rugged and provided redundancy, but had a slower  
response.  The measurement ranges were:                                       
                                                                              
T1: 0 to 520 K with a resolution of approximately 0.12 K per count,           
T2: 0 to 560 K with a resolution of approximately 0.13 K per count,           
                                                                              
c) Three pressure sensors had a common inlet and manifold. The inlet faced    
into the wind to measure free stream total pressure after it was exposed to   
the ambient atmosphere by jettisoning of the aeroshell.                       
                                                                              
The pressure sensors ranges were:                                             
                                                                              
p1, 0 to 0.5 bars with a resolution of approximately 0.0005 bar per count,    
p2, 0 to 4 bars with a resolution of approximately 0.004 bar per count,       
p3, 0 to 28 bars with a resolution of approximately 0.028 bar per count,      
                                                                              
A summary of all the measurements taken during the operational portion of the 
mission is shown in Table 1.

 The instrument electronics received and executed commands from the Probe     
systems and thereby set the experiment mode to Calibrate, Entry, or Descent.  
They controlled the measurement sequences, selected sensor ranges, collected  
data from the three sensor sets, amplified signals, performed A/D conversions,
did some on-board data processing, and conditioned instrument power.  There   
were two A/D converters in the electronics.  The assignment of the various    
sensors to the A/D converters are shown in Table 2.

2.1    Mission Environmental Considerations                                   
===========================================                                   
                                                                              
 At the time of instrument design, the thermal environment within the probe   
during the mission at Jupiter, as specified by the Probe Project Office and   
implemented by the probe contractor, was to fall between -20 C and +50 C.     
The pressure sensors were qualified for -30 C to +60 C, and together with the 
accelerometers, were calibrated for -20 to +50 C.  Since it was recognized    
that the pressure sensors were sensitive to high rates of change of           
temperature, a science requirement on maximum temperature rate (1 C/min) was  
written, and the effects on offset of rates of change of temperature were     
measured for the p2 and p3 sensors at rates between -1 and +3.5 C/min.  For   
the accelerometers, limited measurements of effects of temperature rate were  
obtained during transition between static calibration temperatures at rates   
of about 1 C/min.                                                             
                                                                              
 During descent on Jupiter, temperatures within the probe greatly exceeded    
the predictions.  Temperatures within the various ASI sensors ranged from a   
low of about -50 C to a high of over 117 C, with rates of change of           
temperature as high as  -7.3 C/min.  As a consequence, for a considerable part
of the mission the sensors were outside the temperature range of calibration  
and were operated at high rates of temperature change as well, so that they   
were not at thermal equilibrium.  Flight spare and engineering unit sensors   
were tested after encounter at temperature conditions experienced in Jupiter  
descent, but the response of all sensors to these extreme conditions is not   
identical.  Procedures used to apply the test and calibration data to flight  
data were described in Seiff et al, 1998, Appendix B.                         
                                                                              
2.1.1    Analog to Digital converters.                                        
=====================================                                         
                                                                              
 The A/D converters were calibrated by applying precise test voltages at      
0.02 v intervals to their input terminals and recording output in counts.     
Internal housekeeping/calibration data shows that the converters remained     
within calibration temperatures throughout the mission.  No corrections are   
required.                                                                     
                                                                              
2.1.2    Temperature Sensors                                                  
============================                                                  
                                                                              
 When the temperature of the sensor amplifier became relatively high towards  
the end of the mission, the offsets of the amplifiers appeared to show some   
temperature sensitivity.  The internal calibrations associated with the       
temperature sensor measurements allowed appropriate corrections to be made.   
                                                                              
2.1.3    Pressure Sensors.                                                    
=========================                                                     
                                                                              
 For reasons explained above, it was necessary to extrapolate the calibration 
data for offset and scale factor for sensor temperatures >50 C and <-20 C.    
Several methods were explored and compared.   Use was  made of the Acceptance 
Test calibrations at temperatures from -30 C to +60 C, as well as data taken  
from -50 C to +70 C on the Flight Spare and Engineering sensors, to           
characterize generic behavior.   In addition, the sensor manufacturer was     
consulted.  He was able to combine the predicted variation of the temperature 
compensation network with the empirical observation of the effect of          
temperature on the sensing head to obtain a partly analytical prediction of   
the extended calibration.  The first and most obvious method of extrapolation 
was to assume that the calibration equations which fit the calibration data   
at 5 temperatures within the expected range apply outside this range as well. 
                                                                              
Since the equations for offset are cubics in temperature, they tend to        
significant variation outside the calibration temperature range (see Figs. A2 
and A3 by Seiff et al., 1998.  A second, more conservative approach was to    
use linear extension of the calibrations at the terminal slopes at high and   
low ends of the calibration range.  The equations finally used reflect        
engineering judgment to choose among these alternatives.  Uncertainty in      
offset extrapolation is the dominant uncertainty in the pressure data         
(Table 4, Seiff et al., 1998).  The uncertainties quoted by Seiff et al.      
(1998) are based on the differences among the extrapolation options.          
                                                                              
 The sensor temperature rate corrections on offsets of the p2 and p3 sensors  
were based on pre-launch data taken with the flight sensors.  These data were 
shown in Fig. A4 of Seiff et al., 1998.  They were extremely valuable although
limited in range compared to that experienced in flight.  It was assumed that 
the correction was linear with temperature rate beyond the range of the tests.
                                                                              
Corrections for hysteresis in the temperature rate effect were based on tests 
of the Engineering Unit and Flight Spare sensors which extended to the full   
range of dT/dt experienced in flight.  The spare sensor data also confirmed   
the assumption of linearity in the effect with temperature rate.              
                                                                              
 Sensor temperatures were measured only for the most sensitive sensor         
on-scale, with the assumption that the other sensor active at the same time   
would be at the same temperature.  In the environment encountered  this       
assumption was seen to be not accurate--there is clear discontinuity in       
sensor temperature rate at the transition from p2 prime to p3  prime.  The    
estimated temperature of the p3 sensor while p2 was prime has been included   
in this document.                                                             
                                                                              
 Toward the end of the mission, every 64 seconds, the p3 sensor data jump     
high for 4 samples, and then return back to the generally increasing curve.   
These jumps are small at the beginning and grow in size with rising instrument
temperature.  They occur at the sampling time of one of the engineering       
temperature sensors, during which a current is passed through a platinum      
sensor.  It is thought that the reading offsets result from leakage within a  
multiplexer chip caused by the elevated temperatures, allowing a voltage to   
appear on the p3 calibration line.  These high data spikes should be ignored  
in analyzing data.                                                            
                                                                              
 The calibration data for the pressure sensors in this document include both  
the equations derived from the calibration data and also the equations used   
for final decommutation of the data as our best estimates.  If you go back to 
use these data make sure you know which set you are using!                    
                                                                              
2.1.4    Accelerometer sensors.                                               
==============================                                                
                                                                              
 The rates of change of temperature were sufficiently high to show some       
effect on the accelerometers.  Without a correction, it can be clearly seen   
that the differences between the readings of the two z-axis sensors (although 
small) correlate with the rate of change of temperature.  Fortunately, some   
data were recorded during temperature transients between calibration          
temperature levels, but only at rates of change of temperature of the order of
1 C/min.  These limited data have been used to estimate small corrections.    
                                                                              
 During calibration testing, the x sensor was found not to work reliably at   
temperatures lower than about -14 C.  At the time it was thought that the     
sensor would not reach this temperature during the mission (or if so, for only
a very short time), and since there was no alternate sensor available, this   
performance was accepted.  The actual mission environment put the sensor below
this temperature for an extended period of time during which the lateral      
acceleration output from the instrument is unreliable.  There is no evidence  
that any of the other sensors experienced a similar problem, with onset at    
minimum temperatures lower than -30 C, during the mission.                    
                                                                              
 The calibration equations were used to extrapolate sensor scale factor and   
offset outside the -20 to +50 C range.   The temperature sensitivity of the   
sensors was such that this was judged to be reasonably accurate.              
                                                                              
2.2 Analog to digital converters                                              
================================                                              
                                                                              
2.2.1 Configuration.                                                          
===================                                                           
                                                                              
 Calibrations were performed on the flight instrument analog-to-digital (A/D) 
converters in 1982 prior to delivery of the instrument.  The instrument was   
installed in a temperature controlled oven in a laboratory environment, and   
calibrations were performed at three oven temperatures: nominally -20 C, at   
+24 C,  and at +50 C.  Decommutation of the internal electronics temperature  
sensor showed stabilized internal temperatures to be approximately -21 C,     
+25.5 C,  and +51 C.                                                          
                                                                              
 Calibration voltage inputs to the electronics were made through the          
accelerometer connector and the calibration voltage was applied in parallel to
all of the accelerometer inputs (i.e. to the z1, z2, x, and y inputs).  The   
applied voltage was conditioned within the instrument electronics prior to    
application to the converters.  The z1 and z2 sensors signals in ranges 1,2,  
and 4 pass through a nominal times 2 amplifier.  The z1 and z2 sensors in     
range 3 and all x and y sensor inputs are passed through a nominal 2.5V offset
stage with unity gain.  This input scheme requires some interpretation of the 
results, as discussed later.                                                  
                                                                              
 A stable high precision calibration voltage source (with precision voltmeter)
was used and the input voltage was stepped to provide calibration data through
the nominal range and up to a 28% over-range condition (for conservatism,     
since it was possible that some outputs could go over-range towards the end   
of descent).  The response to the stimulus was measured by operating the      
instrument in the calibration mode and consequently at each voltage setting   
twelve output measurements were made.                                         
                                                                              
 During calibration each sensor signal is sampled 16 times over a one-half    
second period and the 16 sample sum is truncated to a 12-bit output.  The     
appropriate A/D converter offset, measured at the start of the calibration    
cycle, is subtracted from the sensor measurements within the ASI electronics  
prior to placement of the sensor outputs in the data stream.                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.2.2 Results.                                                                
=============                                                                 
                                                                              
 The calibrations performed allow several possible analysis paths.  The       
following sections investigate and compare different approaches for the       
analysis.  Recommendations are made in section 2.2.3.  The overall result is  
that the A/D converters were accurate and linear to within about 1 count, but 
were corrected for these small deviations from linearity and scale factor.    
                                                                              
2.2.2.1 A/D converter internal calibration voltage.                           
==================================================                            
                                                                              
 Each A/D converter provides an internal calibration measurement derived from 
a precision 2.5 volt source.  This source is derived from the A/D converter   
reference voltage (as were all calibration stimuli within the ASI) and        
consequently should track any changes in the reference voltage.               
                                                                              
 Using this internal calibration data alone the following calibration         
constants are indicated:                                                      
                                                                              
 A/D converter #1: 1.2201 mV/bit                                              
                                                                              
 A/D converter #2: 1.2207 mV/bit                                              
                                                                              
 Nominal performance = 5000 mV/4096 bits = 1.2207 mV/bit                      
                                                                              
 The small difference in sensitivity between the two converters is  supported 
by other measurements and appears to be real even though it falls within      
worst case measurement errors for the data.  For example the T2 reference     
measurement made using A/D #1 during Calibration was a count of 3671 and a    
count of 3669 when using A/D converter #2 during Descent.                     
                                                                              
2.2.2.2 A/D converter applied voltage calibration.                            
=================================================                             
                                                                              
 The A/D converter calibrations as measured are potentially impacted by       
instrument electronics which lie between the applied voltage and the A/D      
converters.  Four items are of interest:                                      
                                                                              
 1) The value of the nominal 2.5 V offset associated with the gain of x 1     
amplifier                                                                     
 2) The gain of the nominal x 1 amplifier                                     
 3) The gain of the nominal x 2 amplifier                                     
 4) Amplifier offsets.                                                        
                                                                              
 Any offset of the gain of x 2 amplifier will contribute to the A/D converter 
offset error and any offset of the gain of x 1 amplifier will contribute to   
the 2.5 V offset error.  Gain errors will result in A/D converter slope       
errors.                                                                       
                                                                              
 In the hardware, as configured, there were two independent accelerometer     
signal processing channels.  The z1 and x accelerometers have their own       
amplification chain and are converted to digital in A/D #1.  The z2 and y     
accelerometers have their chain and are converted to digital in A/D #2.  The  
accelerometer signal voltage comes into the instrument central electronics    
through a multiplexer into a high input impedance amplifier with unity  gain  
and then into internal conditioning electronics described above.  The gains   
are controlled by appropriate resistor networks.  All resistors for a channel 
are high stability Vishay resistors contained within a single package and so  
should provide reasonable gain stability.   The 2.5 Volt offset is derived    
from the A/D converter reference voltage and so should also be very stable in 
it's tracking of the reference voltage.  It would appear that the major       
potential source of error is a temperature sensitivity in the operational     
amplifier offset voltages in all stages including the offset voltage.         
                                                                              
 Analyses have been run in which the above parameters have been held constant 
at the nominal values and also allowed to float while obtaining the best      
least squares fit to the data.  These computations were performed for voltage 
inputs to the A/D converters in the range 0 to 4.8 Volts.  The analysis       
technique for each of the cases was as follows:                               
                                                                              
Case 1: All parameters were held at the nominal values;                       
                                                                              
Case 2: The gains were held at the nominal values and the 2.5 V offset        
allowed to float;                                                             
                                                                              
Case 3: The x 2 gain was held at the nominal value and the other parameters   
allowed to float;                                                             
                                                                              
Case 4: The x 1 gain was held at the nominal value and the other parameters   
allowed to float;                                                             
                                                                              
Case 5: All parameters were allowed to float                                  
                                                                              
 Examination of the various fit results shows an obvious temperature          
sensitivity associated with the 2.5 V offset.  Improvements in fit are        
obtained when all parameters are allowed to float.  Although the improvement  
is not fundamentally significant when the potential data measurement errors   
are considered it does indicate that we should consider tailoring calibration 
constants for each measurement type.  To be specific, the accelerometer       
measurements may need a slightly different calibration constants set from all 
the other measurements.                                                       
                                                                              
 The difference between the input data and the best fits show that the A/D    
converter linearity begins to roll-off at about the 4.6 Volt input level      
(about 3750 DN).  It must be pointed out however that we can not              
differentiate between an amplifier characteristic and an A/D converter        
characteristic as being the cause for this roll-off.  The results of these    
fits, which used data in the 0 to 4.8 V range, can be used with reasonable    
accuracy to at least the nominal A/D converter full scale.  Beyond full scale 
(a measurement condition not encountered in the mission) additional           
correction would be advisable.  (Note: The p3 data did exceed the 4.8V level  
when the 1.25V calibration input voltage was applied late in the descent.)    
                                                                              
 The Case 5 data provides the following values for the A/D converter slopes:  
                                                                              
 A/D converter #1: 1.2200 mV/bit                                              
                                                                              
 A/D converter #2: 1.2205 mV/bit                                              
                                                                              
The data also indicate a slight temperature sensitivity with the slope        
increasing by a total of 0.4 microV/bit over the full 70 C temperature range. 
This is about +0.0057 microV/bit/degree C.                                    
                                                                              
 The fits generated by the Case 2 analyses are appropriate for the            
accelerometer measurements.  Temperature sensitivities of the gains are       
relatively small when compared with the offset variation and very little      
additional error is generated by rolling all of the temperature effects into  
the offset variation (it results in an increase in the fit standard deviation 
of only 6 microV which is insignificant when compared with other error        
sources, and the assumption certainly simplifies data processing).            
                                                                              
Case 2 data provides the following values for the A/D converter slopes:       
                                                                              
 A/D converter #1: 1.2198 mV/bit                                              
                                                                              
 A/D converter #2: 1.2204 mV/bit                                              
                                                                              
The linear fit equations for the variation in offset with temperature are:    
                                                                              
 Channel 1: Offset = 2.4988 + Temp x 1.0699 x 10^(-5)                         
                                                                              
 Channel 2: Offset = 2.4978 + Temp x 3.5787 x 10^(-5)                         
                                                                              
where the offset is in volts and the temperature in degrees C.  The variation 
with temperature is consistent with case 5.                                   
                                                                              
It is important to note that the actual value for the Offset is not really    
important unless there are significant temperature changes during the mission 
after the calibration sequence.  Actual values, as measured during

====================================                                          
                                                                              
 The applied voltage calibrations show agreement with the internal            
calibrations and lie well within the bit error spread.  In fact it could be   
argued that there is little difference of significance between any of the     
results.                                                                      
                                                                              
 The following values for the various calibration constants appear to         
represent the best data available from the A/D converter calibrations and     
should be used.

2.3    Temperature Sensors                                                    
==========================                                                    
                                                                              
 The flight temperature sensor, SN 153, was the first flight unit             
manufactured.  Its first and probably most accurate calibration was performed 
on Nov. 25, 1981 at Rosemount, prior to shipment.  It was enclosed in a       
plastic bag, totally immersed in a sequence of 5 baths of known temperature,  
and, at temperature equilibrium, element resistances were recorded to the     
nearest tenth milliohm (the last figure and possibly the preceding one are of 
doubtful repeatability and significance).  The baths were ice-water, boiling  
water, liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen, and an undescribed bath at a           
temperature of 477.6 K.                                                       
                                                                              
 Subsequently, the sensor was calibrated at Ames:  at the ice point 5 times   
over the period from Jan., 1983 to Jan., 1988; in liquid nitrogen 6 times from
Jan., 83 to May, 85; in a dry-ice/acetone bath in May, 85; and at the boiling 
point of water 3 times from Jan., 83 to May, 84.  The Ames calibration        
technique evolved over time, but had one essential difference from that at    
Rosemount:  The sensor mounting pad was not immersed in the baths.  Thus,     
there was some conduction of heat down the stem, as there was on the probe    
at Jupiter.  In 1995, an Ames test dedicated to evaluating the effect of      
temperature difference between the mounting pad and sensor head or stem       
conduction on measured temperature under conditions simulating those expected 
in flight indicated that, at the test conditions, the effect was about        
0.001 C/degree of temperature difference from mounting pad to atmosphere.     
Extrapolated to the heat transfer conditions of flight, it was even smaller   
by orders of magnitude.   The associated calibration error in a stirred bath  
at 0 C was evaluated to be about 10^(-2) C.                                   
                                                                              
A second difference between Ames and Rosemount calibrations was that, in      
early Ames calibrations, the sensor was directly immersed in liquid nitrogen, 
in an ice bath, and in boiling water without bag enclosure.  This practice    
was later abandoned, being found to degrade the insulation resistance as a    
result of moisture seeping into the insulation inside the sensor frame        
through pin hole leaks in the brazed joints of the tubing.  Insulation        
resistance returned to normal values when the sensor was kept at vacuum       
overnight in an oven at 90 C or higher.                                       
                                                                              
 To avoid moisture in the insulation, Ames calibrations after 1983 were       
typically performed with the sensor immersed in intermediate baths of methyl  
or ethyl alcohol, which do not lower the insulation resistance and which      
evaporate quickly.  To somewhat simulate the flight situation, the sensor was 
immersed in calibration baths only to the rings on the sensor stem, where the 
flexible closure to the probe aerofairing was made.                           
                                                                              
Values of Ro, the ice point resistance of T1 and T2, for SN 153 were constant 
to within 0.01 ohm (0.2 K) over periods of 4 to 5 years.  In 1983, repair of  
an insulation resistance short at the lead-to-sensor junction of T2 caused    
an increase in (R2)o of 0.11 ohm.   In June and July, 1992, from a critical   
evaluation of the collected data, selected values of the sensor resistances   
at 0 C, Ro, were 14.007 ohms (T1) and 10.486 ohms (T2).  Final values,        
derived just prior to encounter, and used for mission analyses were           
14.017 ohms for T1 and 10.504 ohms for T2.  The original Rosemount Ro for     
T1 was 13.9994 ohms.  The difference, 0.0176 ohms, corresponds to 0.32 K.     
                                                                              
 In November, 1983, the sensor was coated with parylene to prevent shorting   
of the sensor by conductive cloud droplets.  This coating was overlaid with   
1000 Angstroms of gold to maintain the sensor exterior surface at the         
electric potential of the probe.  Calibrations made before and after this     
date on SN 153 and other sensors indicated that the calibration was not       
significantly affected by these thin coatings.                                
                                                                              
 Liquid nitrogen calibrations using the above Ro's showed very small          
uncertainty and excellent repeatability.  The T1, T2 differences were         
extremely small, of order of 0.03 K.                                          
                                                                              
 To test the sensors over the higher temperature range to 500K, a closed      
circuit flow channel was built, in which gas (air or helium) was circulated   
at atmospheric pressure at a velocity of 4.2 m/sec. Electrical heaters        
warmed the gas to match the rate expected in descent on Jupiter.  T1 and T2   
readings were compared with one another, and with readings from calibrated    
thermocouples.                                                                
                                                                              
 There were temporal and spatial variations in temperature of the order of    
+0.4 K in the flow through this channel.  When the environment was cooling    
from 500K back to room temperature, flow temperatures were more uniform.      
Under these conditions, T1 and T2 agreed within about 0.3K from 330 to 420 K. 
With corrections for non-simultaneous sampling and for the response lag of    
T2, which was 12 to 50 X larger in the channel than on Jupiter, disagreement  
of the two elements was about 0.15 K at 420 K.   The quantitative accuracy    
of these results was limited to a few tenths K by the spatial and temporal    
fluctuations, non-simultaneous sampling and response lag of T2.               
                                                                              
 Tests made at the sensor level and end-to-end with the electronics showed    
that the end-to-end data were consistent with analog sensor level             
calibrations within 1 count.  Tests with and without the electrostatic        
discharge shield (Seiff and Knight, 1992) showed that it did not              
significantly affect the readings.                                            
                                                                              
Overall, the data suggest a maximum absolute calibration uncertainty for both 
T1 and T2 sensors of about 0.3K at 500K, where absolute error should be       
maximum.  The  uncertainty at 273 K was about 0.1 K, and at 100 K, about      
0.1 K.  Relative accuracy over short time spans should be limited only by the 
resolution, 0.013 K.   Expected response times are 16 msec at deployment to   
5 msec at 16 bars for the primary sensor, and from 300 msec to 80 msec for    
the secondary.

 A small further correction given by the Rosemount calibration compensates    
for deviations of individual sensor calibrations from the International       
Practical Temperature Scale, IPTS, of Table 3.  These corrections, of order   
0.15 K maximum, are defined by the respective equations for T1 and T2,        
                                                                              
Delta(w1) = -4.560x10^(-4)+0.136883x10^(-4)xT-4.40009x10^(-8)xT^(2)           
Delta(w2) = 22.448x10^(-4)-0.27888x10^(-4)xT+7.201109x10^(-8)xT^(2)           
                                                                              
These corrections are to be subtracted from measured values of w before       
converting to temperature.  The corrections are not very well defined for     
temperatures between 110 and 250 K, since the defining data were located only 
near the end points.  Perhaps the greatest contribution of the dry-ice in     
acetone bath calibration was to provide a confirming point at 188.7 K, where  
the agreement of the ASI sensors with the Lab Standard thermometer was, in 4  
cases out of 8, within 0.1 K.  It was improved by the Delta(w) corrections in 
one comparison, was essentially the same in another, and was worsened in two  
comparisons.  The T1, T2 agreement was improved by the corrections in both of 
the two tests analyzed.

=======================                                                       
                                                                              
2.4.1    Decalibration Overview.                                              
===============================                                               
                                                                              
 The response of the Tavis pressure sensors to applied pressure is nearly     
linear, but the small departures from linearity should not be neglected.      
The decalibration procedure first defines the pressure for a linear sensor,   
then applies a small non-linear correction.  The primary calibration          
constants are sensor scale factors, in mb/mV or b/v; the offsets, or readings 
at zero pressure, in mV; and the characterization of non-linearity.  All are  
slightly sensitive to sensor internal temperatures, which are measured once   
per major frame.                                                              
                                                                              
  The initial step in the decalibration is to obtain an equation representing 
sensor temperatures as functions of time.  This variation is used to          
calculate the calibration constants appropriate to each measurement time.     
Note:  Sensor temperatures derived from the mission data are shown as a       
function of time in Table 4.  Sensor temperatures should be derived from      
this table by interpolation.                                                  
                                                                              
 Sensor offsets, in mV, do not repeat identically from turn-on to turn-on.    
Nominal variation is about 10 mV (2 counts).  The initial offsets at          
encounter were taken from pre-entry calibration data (PEC). (The offset has   
been shown to remain stable through full range pressure cycles after turn-on. 
In the encounter, the sensors were turned on prior to entry and remained on   
through end of mission.)                                                      
                                                                              
 Test data have shown that offset varies not only with sensor temperature,    
but also with temperature rate as a result of temperature nonuniformity       
within the sensor.  The corrections for temperature rate have been derived    
post mission by a series of tests and analytical considerations and the best  
estimates are shown in Table 5.  Values used should be derived from this      
table by interpolation.                                                       
                                                                              
 The decalibration can thus be represented by the following equation:         
                         plin = [Reading - Offset(T, dT/dt)] . SF(T).         
                         p = plin + Delta(pnl),                               
                                                                              
Reading and Offset in mV.                                                     
                                                                              
The notation "Offset(T,dT/dt)" indicates offset is a function of T and dT/dt, 
while "SF(T)" indicates SF is a function of only T.  Equations describing     
these variations and the non-linear corrections Delta(pnl) are given below.   
                                                                              
Note also that a final value for atmospheric pressure to be derived from the  
sensor pressures is a further correction for the ram effect associated with   
the probe falling through the atmosphere.  This dynamic pressure correction   
is computed from 0.5 rho V^2.  It had a nominal value of -5 mb.  When         
computed point-by-point from velocities derived from dp/dt, the rate of       
pressure increase, it was found to be somewhat noisy, giving values from -4   
to -9 mb.  The noise was introduced by the digital resolution of the pressure 
data, and should not be considered to be real variation in the dynamic        
pressure.  It is recommended that a constant value of - 5 mb be used except   
possibly in the first few pressure samples before equilibrium descent is      
achieved.                                                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.4.2    Scale Factors.

 For Readings and offsets in mV, the linear scale factors are defined as a    
function of temperature by:

 The behavior of the p3 sensor outside of the calibration range was not so    
predictable as within the calibration range.  It was found necessary to go to 
a higher order polynomial to match the behavior over the much wider mission   
temperature range.  The modified (for the mission temperature environment)    
expression for range 3 that should be used for analyses is:

 The offset or bias at turn-on a few minutes before Jupiter entry, was        
measured in Calibrate Mode at temperature T, from which the value at          
zero degrees C, B0C, is calculated.                                           
                                      B0C = (B- Delta(B)pec)                  
                                                                              
DeltaB(T) is given for each range by equations fitted to the calibration      
data. The values of B at temperatures experienced in Descent are then         
calculated from

There was no offset temperature dependence within the narrow temperature

The following equation derives from  4 data sets, taken between April, 84

2.4.4    Nonlinearities:                                                      
=======================                                                       
                                                                              
2.4.4.1    Range 1:                                                           
===================                                                           
                                                                              
The correction is small, and unsymmetrical, and ranges from +0.5 mb at 100 mb 
to -0.7 mb at 350 mb.                                                         
                                                                              
Delta(pnl) = 0.905-0.00184xp-2.635x10^(-5)xp^(2)+5.294x10^(-8)x p^(3).        
                                                                              
This equation represents data taken at temperatures from -15 degrees C to     
+50 degrees C within the scatter.   The correction equation is not applicable 
at p < 100 mb.  It gives the erroneous result Delta(pnl) = 0.905 mb at p = 0, 
where Delta(pnl) is zero by definition.                                       
                                                                              
 Through the series of calibrations, corrections repeat only within a few     
tenths of a mb.  In 1983, a peak deviation from linearity of ~-1.2 mb         
occurred at 300 mb and 50 degrees C (a condition not expected to occur in     
flight), and at 100 mb, the +0.5 mb correction of the equation was, instead,  
-0.2 mb. The change is attributed to sensor aging or diaphragm relaxation,    
and the small diaphragm deflection force available at these pressures. It     
implies possible errors of 0.5 mb or 0.1% of full scale.                      
                                                                              
2.4.4.2    Range 2:

The behavior on Range 2 was orderly, and is represented by a parabola with    
its maximum at mid-range and a temperature dependent amplitude.  The          
correction at pressure p is:                                                  
                                                                              
Delta(pnl) = A[1 - (1 - p/2)^(2)],                                            
                                                                              
where 2 bars is the mid-range pressure.  The temperature variation of the     
amplitude is represented by                                                   
                                                                              
A = -9 - 0.1776xT-0.003436xT^(2)+0.0001158xT^(3) mb, T in degrees C.          
                                                                              
Note that A is negative.  It peaks at -14.5 mb (3.6 counts) at 35 K.          
Accuracy is probably no better than 1 mb , or 1/4 count on Range 2.           
The form of A(T) is similar to that of Delta(B(T)).

===================                                                           
                                                                              
The nonlinear corrections are well defined and were stable over a period of   
years to within a few mb.  They were not symmetrical about mid range, but     
peaked at around 8.5 to 9 bars.                                               
                                                                              
 No simple, single equation fits the data well. To permit analytical          
representation, the data were fitted on each side of the peak independently   
at two temperatures, 20 degrees C and 50 degrees C.  Corrections were         
derived from the 4 equations which follow with linear temperature             
interpolation. E.g., at sensor temperature = 35 degrees C, the correction     
was the mean of those at 20 and 50 C.

2.4.6    Temperature Rate Correction to P2 and P3 Offsets                     
=========================================================                     
                                                                              
Corrections for temperature rate were derived from tests of the flight        
sensors before launch, and from tests of the engineering model and flight     
spare sensors after encounter.  These corrections and their derivation were   
discussed in Appendix B, Seiff et al., 1998.  The corrections are tabulated   
below at each sample interval, first for range 2, the 0 to 4 bar sensor, and  
then for range 3, the 0 to 28 bar sensor.  The corrections are given to the   
nearest millibar, which is 1/4 count on range 2 and 1/28 count on range 3,    
but are uncertain to ~20% of the values given (Seiff et al., 1998).  Cubic    
spline interpolation of the following table is recommended for determining    
correction values at intermediate times.                                      
                                                                              
The corrections are to be added to the values of pressure derived by the      
procedures outlined above.

=====================                                                         
                                                                              
2.5.1    Decalibration Overview.                                              
================================                                              
                                                                              
 The basic accelerometer calibrations were done before and after              
qualification testing at Bell Aerospace in Dec., 1983 and Feb., 1984, at      
four temperatures from -20 to +50 degrees C. In 1985, a resistor in the       
temperature compensation network of the z1 sensor failed and had to be        
replaced by Bell.  After repair, on July 2, 1985, the z1, z2, and y sensors   
were calibrated a third time.  The x-axis sensor was not recalibrated at      
this time because the x axis was used as the horizontal axis of rotation.     
                                                                              
 It is also important to be aware that the x-axis sensor is limited to        
temperatures above -14.7 degrees C by the available travel of its internal    
bellows, the function of which is to allow expansion and contraction of the   
fill fluid.  The x-axis calibration became erratic below  ~15 degrees C.      
The other 3 sensors operate properly down to at least -20 degrees C.          
                                                                              
 Scale factors and offsets were measured by rotating the sensors in the       
Earth's gravity field, used as a calibration standard.  In Bell's calibration 
lab, 1 g = 9.803880 m/s/s. At bench level in the high bay of Ames building    
244, it is 9.799284 m/s/s.  The  difference is 0.047%.  On the higher ranges, 
the sensors were rotated through 360 degrees.  For ranges <1g, rotation was   
stopped at the full scale reading, and bias and scale factor were determined  
from accurate leveling and accurate angle measure.  The zero level            
orientation was transferred from a range which permits 360 degree rotation.   
                                                                              
 On Range 4, it was considered undesirable to rely on calibration below 1 g   
to define the full 410 g range.  The above procedure was therefore            
supplemented by stimulus current calibrations to full scale g levels with the 
sensor at room temperature, both at Bell and at Ames. The stimulus current    
calibrations were found to agree with the 0 to 1 g calibrations within 0.18%  
in z1 and 0.15% in z2, which indicates  two things:  1) that Bell had         
measured the signal at 1g accurate within a few micro volts, and 2) that      
sensor response to acceleration is highly linear.  The variations of scale    
factor with temperature on Range 4 were thus taken from the 0 to 1 g          
calibrations, and the absolute levels were corrected by use of the more       
accurate stimulus currents.                                                   
                                                                              
 At Ames, room temperature calibration checks  were performed on all ranges   
at each complete instrument test from 1984 through 1988 in the Ames 1 g       
field.  An accurate dividing head was used to set sensor rotation angles and  
the ASI electronics were use to take readings.  There was no significant      
disagreement with the Bell results.                                           
                                                                              
 The three Bell scale factor calibrations repeated typically to 3 significant 
figures or better.  However, bias shifts from turn-on to turn-on, varied by   
as much as a few hundred micro-g's.  The calibration equations were derived   
from the Bell data by fitting polynomials to the calibration data points.     
The calibration of July, 1985, was used as the calibration of record, except  
for x, for which the final calibration after qualification testing in Feb.,   
1983 was used.  The disagreements among Bell calibrations in both scale       
factor and bias were small uniform shifts of values at all temperatures,      
indicating that the shifts were systematic.  Temperature dependence was well  
duplicated among them.                                                        
                                                                              
 The conversion of direct acceleration readings from counts to m/s/s is       
similar to that of the pressure data.  First, offset is subtracted from a     
reading to obtain the net reading, a, in counts.                              
                                                                              
                               a  = Reading - Offset (counts)                 
                                                                              
Offset or bias, B, is the reading at zero input, and is a function of sensor  
temperature, Ta , which is monitored by internal resistance thermometers in   
each sensor.                                                                  
                                                                              
                               B = Bo + DeltaB(Ta)                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
Bo, the bias at 0 degrees C, is obtained from the sensor output during        
pre-entry calibration (pec), when acceleration is zero.                       
                                                                              
                               Bo = Bpec - DeltaB(Tpec)                       
                                                                              
where DeltaB(Ta) is defined by the bias temperature dependence equation,      
                                                                              
                               DeltaB(Ta)  = a1T + a2T^(2) + a3T^(3).         
                                                                              
The coefficients a1, a2, and a3 are given in the equation for B(T) for each   
sensor. Since Bo is not constant over long periods of time, values of Bo      
given in the figures, obtained during calibration, are discarded in favor of  
those determined from pre-entry calibration.                                  
                                                                              
For the z sensors in range 3 and for the x and y sensors in all ranges an     
additional offset correction needs to be made for the temperature sensitivity 
of the 2.5 V offset in the A/D converters, using the temperature of the       
electronics (Te) as the variable (not the temperatures of the accelerometer   
sensors).  The relevant equation then becomes:                                
                                                                              
                               B = Bo + DeltaB(Ta) + bias(2.5V)               
                                                                              
 With Bo, B, and bias(2.5V)  determined, the net reading, a, in counts is     
obtained and converted to Earth g's (Bell g's) and to m/s/s by multiplying by 
the sensor scale factor in g/count and by 9.80388 m/s/s/g.                    
                                                                              
                               a=a(counts)xSF(Ta)x9.80388    m/s/s.           
                                                                              
2.5.2    Lateral (x and y) Outputs.                                           
===================================                                           
                                                                              
 Measurements from the two lateral accelerometers were output directly as     
12-bit words only in the pre-entry calibration sequence.  During both entry   
and descent, because of the Probe memory limitation, the measurements were    
processed within the instrument to provide the absolute magnitude of the      
resultant lateral accelerations as 8-bit words.  The processing comprises     
the following steps:                                                          
                                                                              
1)  The x and y measurements were each converted to absolute magnitude and    
rounded to 8-bit words                                                        
                                                                              
2)  The 8-bit words were squared and summed. The sum was multiplied by 2      
                                                                              
3)  The square root of the resulting 18 bit word was computed.                
                                                                              
4)  The resulting 9-bit word was rounded to 8-bits.  This 8-bit word was      
written into the data stream.                                                 
                                                                              
 Converting the lateral accelerometer outputs to m/s/s involves an assumption 
and some uncertainty since the relative contributions of the x and y sensors  
are not known.  The truncation of the measured data to 8-bit resolution (made 
necessary by the available data rate and the memory allocation), simplifies   
the data conversion in that temperature variation of the 2.5V offset and the  
effects of temperature rate can be neglected compared with the resolution.    
The assumption we have made in our processing is that the x and y sensors     
contribute equally to the resultant.  This approach is equivalent to          
averaging the calibration characteristics of the x and y sensors and is       
accurate within the 8-bit resolution.  (The two sensor calibrations did not   
differ significantly.)                                                        
                                                                              
2.5.3    Scale Factors and Offsets.

 All temperatures, T are in degrees C and the temperatures of the relevant    
sensor should be used.  Bo is calculated from the given equations and the     
data for Bpec at (Ta)pec.

2.5.4    Temperature Rate Correction to z1 and z2 Offsets                     
=========================================================                     
                                                                              
 The data that forms the basis for temperature rate corrections were gathered 
during the periods of changing temperature during the sensor calibration      
tests.  Data were gathered in transients from 28 degrees C to -20 degrees C,  
-20 degrees C to 0 degrees C, 0 degrees C to 28 degrees C, and 28 degrees C   
to 50 degrees C.  In each data set the rate would start at zero, increase to  
some maximum value (a negative maximum for the first transient) and then      
reduce again to zero.  The rates of change of temperature experienced during  
these tests were bracketed between about -1.2 C/minute and +0.6 C/minute.     
                                                                              
 These data showed an effect on offset of changing temperatures which was not 
closed and which resulted in offsets from the true steady state conditions as 
well as offsets during the temperature transients.  The rates of change of    
temperature during these temperature transients did not approach the rates    
attained during the mission ( which were bracketed between about              
-4.9 C/minute and +4.3 C/minute.) and consequently analyses have been kept    
relatively simple.                                                            
                                                                              
 The approach followed has been to compute offsets as a function of           
temperature rate and compute the best straight line fit for the initial       
transient to maximum rate of change for each of the temperature transients    
and then a second fit from the maximum rate of change back to zero.  (For     
example, for z1 for the 28 degrees C to -20 degrees C transient the slope of  
the fit to the data while the rate was increasing is -8.1373.10^(-5) V/degrees
C/min and the slope while the rate was decreasing is -9.237.10^(-5) V/degrees 
C/min).  These slopes are then used for all rates attained during the mission.
                                                                              
 Based on the above, corrections have been made for data during descent.      
Temperature transients were observed for the z1 and z2 sensors during the     
entry phase.  However this transient resulted from self-heating as a result   
of the high energy dissipation within the sensor during the large g portion   
of deceleration.  It is not clear that the results for self-heating should    
be the same as for external heating, as occurred during testing and descent.  
                                                                              
Slopes derived from the test data are:                                        
                                                                              
z1  Temperature decreasing, rate of change of temperature going more negative:
Slope (m1) =-8.1373x10^(-5) V/degrees C/min

Slope (m2) =-9.237x10^(-5) V/degrees C/min

z2  Temperature decreasing, rate of change of temperature going more negative:
Slope (m1) =+1.3265x10^(-4) V/degrees C/min                                   
                                                                              
z2  Temperature decreasing, rate of change of temperature going less negative:
Slope (m2) =+8.861x10^(-5) V/degrees C/min                                    
                                                                              
z2  Temperature increasing, rate of change of temperature going more positive:
Slope (m3) =+5.0779x10^(-4) V/degrees C/min                                   
                                                                              
z2  Temperature increasing, rate of change of temperature going less positive:
Slope (m4) =-4.0007x10^(-5) V/degrees C/min                                   
                                                                              
The computational techniques used separately for the z1 and z2 channels were: 
                                                                              
1)  For each measurement sample, starting at the beginning of descent,        
compute the rate of change of sensor temperature.                             
                                                                              
2)  Compute the offset using the slope appropriate for the particular phase   
of the mission.                                                               
                                                                              
3)  When the rate reaches a transition between slopes use the last computed   
offset as the starting point for the application of the new slope.            
                                                                              
4)  Convert the offset in volts to counts using the appropriate A/D converter 
sensitivity to yield the value for bias(Trate).                               
                                                                              
The relevant bias equation then becomes:                                      
                                                                              
                       Bo+DeltaB(Ta)+bias(2.5V)-bias(Trate)                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
The magnitude of these corrections ranges between -0.3 and +0.3 counts for z1 
and between -1.6 to +0.5 counts for z2.                                       
                                                                              
2.5.5  Sensor Temperature Calibrations                                        
======================================                                        
                                                                              
 The equations of sensor temperature as a function of internal sensor         
resistance are given below.  This includes data from all three Bell           
calibrations.                                                                 
                                                                              
 Two different equations must be used to convert readings from counts to ohms 
for the 12 bit data of the PEC, and the 8 bit data of Entry and Descent.      
                                                                              
 During Pre-entry Calibration, the equation is                                
                                                                              
                  R (ohms)  = 0.4016 (ohms/count)xReading (counts)            
                                                                              
with resolution of 0.4 ohm or about 0.11 degrees C.                           
                                                                              
 During Entry and Descent, the 8 bit resolution was improved by discarding    
the MSB, giving effectively 9 bit resolution.                                 
                                                                              
              R (ohms) = [Reading (counts)+256]x3.2124 (ohms/cnt) , with      
resolution of about 0.9 degrees C.                                            
                                                                              
 To distinguish the 4 sensor temperatures, the notation Tx, Ty, Tz1, and Tz2  
is used.  The resistance notation is, e.g., Rz1T is the resistance in ohms    
of the z1 internal temperature sensor.

Tz2 = -285.67+0.2843xRz2T-3.902x10^(-5)xRz2T^(2)                              
                                                                              
Tx = -276.04+0.27205xRxT-3.609x10^(-5)xRxT^(2)                                
                                                                              
Ty = -279.53+0.2775xRyT-3.8363x10^(-5)xRyT^(2)
