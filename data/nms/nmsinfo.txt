This file will contain more information about the structure                   
of the GPMS pre-launch characterization data files (March                     
and April, 1985) and about the post-entry lab simulation                      
work with the similar laboratory "engineering" unit.

The pre-launch data files currently available should be                       
used ONLY for qualitative identification (fragmentation                       
patterns) --- NOT for quantitative evaluations.                               
                                                                              
The review processes to insure the validity and integrity of                  
these data (files) has not yet been completed.                                
                                                                              
Initial information has been included in these data files                     
but has not yet been fully explained.  This is being corrected.               
                                                                              
Work is continuing to fully define and finalize the available data.
