The LRD data have not yet been submitted by the instrument team due to the    
recent death of one of the Co-Investigators. We are hoping to be able to      
generate a supplementary data set in the future, but we are not optimistic.   
                                                                              
The following references relate to the LRD instrument and results:            
[LANZEROTTIETAL1992], [LANZEROTTIETAL1996], [RINNERTETAL1998],                
[RINNERT&LANZEROT1998], [LANZEROTTIETAL1998]                                  
(See the REF.CAT file in the CATALOG directory.)                              
These references will have the best information that the investigators had    
available. Under the circumstances, we wish we could have done more.
