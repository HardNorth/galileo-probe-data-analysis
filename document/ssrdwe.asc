     Abstract. Ultrastable oscillators onboard the Galileo Probe and Orbiter  
will permit very accurate determinations of the frequency of the Probe's      
telemetry signal as the Probe descends from a pressure level of several       
hundred mb to a level of about 20 bars. Analysis of the time-varying frequency
can provide, in principle, a unique and important definition of the vertical  
profile of the zonal wind speed in the Jovian atmosphere. In this paper, we   
develop a protocol for retrieving the zonal wind profile from the Doppler     
shift of the measured frequency; assess the impact of a wide range of error   
sources on the accuracy of the retrieved wind profile; and perform a number of
simulations to illustrate our technique and to assess the likely accuracy of  
the retrieval.                                                                
     Because of unavoidably large uncertainties in the absolute frequencies of
the oscillators, we use time-differenced frequencies in our analysis.         
Nevertheless, it is possible to recover absolute wind speeds as well as wind  
shears, since the Orbiter/Probe geometry changes significantly during the     
Probe relay link. We begin with the full relativistic Doppler shift equation. 
Through the use of power series expansions and a basis function representation
of the wind profiles, we reduce the basic equation to a set of linear         
equations that can be solved with standard linear least-squares techniques.   
     There are a very large number of instrumental and environmental factors  
that can introduce errors into the measured signal or to the recovery of zonal
winds from the data. We provide estimates of the magnitudes of all these error
sources and consider the degree to which they may be reduced by a posteriori  
information as well as the results of calibration tests. The most important   
error source is the a posteriori uncertainty in the Probe's entry longitude.  
The accuracy of the retrieved winds is also limited by errors in the Probe's  
descent velocity, as obtained from atmospheric parameters measured by several 
Probe experiments, and in the a posteriori knowledge of secular drifts in the 
oscillators' frequencies during the relay link, due, for example, to aging and
radiation damage.                                                             
     Our simulations indicate that zonal winds may be retrieved from the      
Doppler data to an accuracy of several m s^-1. Therefore, it may be possible  
to discriminate among alternative models for the basic drive of the zonal     
winds, since they differ significantly in the implied zonal wind profile.     
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                  1. Introduction                             
                                                                              
     The Galileo spacecraft consists of a Probe that will enter Jupiter's     
atmosphere and an Orbiter that will make multiple close flybys of the Galilean
satellites of Jupiter. The Probe contains six science instruments that will   
conduct the first in-situ measurements of the structure and composition of the
Jovian atmosphere. The data from these measurements will be sent to a receiver
on the Orbiter over approximately a 60-min interval that occurs soon after a  
close flyby of Io and shortly before commencement of orbit insertion          
maneuvers. The presence of ultra-stable oscillators on both the Probe and     
Orbiter will provide very accurate measurements of the frequency of the       
telemetry signal. As a result, it may be possible to derive useful information
on the vertical profile of the horizontal winds. Such a profile could provide 
a valuable constraint on alternative models for the basic drive of the Jovian 
winds, as described shortly.                                                  
     In this paper, we describe an in-depth analysis of the methodology and   
practicality of retrieving a wind profile from the Probe's Doppler signal that
the authors of this paper have been carrying out over the last 10 years.      
Although we will present a thorough discussion of this problem here, a much   
more detailed presentation can be found in the Ph.D. dissertation of one of us
(Atkinson, 1989; henceforth Paper I). In the remainder of this section, we    
summarize past attempts to derive data on winds of planetary atmospheres other
than that of the Earth, indicate the aspects of the Galileo Doppler data that 
makes it challenging to retrieve wind formation, and describe the organization
of this paper.                                                                
     Estimates of wind speeds in planetary atmospheres have been obtained in a
number of ways. These include tracking cloud features seen on images taken    
from space and the ground, measuring the Doppler shift and positional shift of
entry Probes and balloons, and applying the thermal wind equation to measured 
temperature fields. All three techniques have been applied with considerable  
success to Venus' atmosphere (e.g., Counselman et al., 1980; Kerzhanovich et  
al., 1972; Marov et al., 1973; Preston et al., 1986; Limaye, 1985; Rossow et  
al., 1980; Sagdeev et al., 1986; Schubert et al., 1980; Taylor et al., 1980). 
To date, only the first and third of these techniques have been used to study 
winds in the Jovian atmosphere (e.g., Ingersoll et al., 1981; Conrath et al., 
1981; Gierasch, 1976).                                                        
     The three approaches to deriving winds are complementary. Feature        
tracking can provide a good definition of the global distribution of wind     
speeds at one or at most several vertical layers in the atmosphere (namely,   
at the level of the first optically thick cloud layer). Measurements of the   
motion of entry Probes yield a detailed vertical profile of the horizontal    
wind speeds (and, in restricted circumstances vertical wind speeds) at        
isolated locations. Finally, winds obtained from measurements of              
three-dimensional temperature distributions can provide useful estimates of   
the vertical shear in the east-west (zonal) wind speed (and, in certain       
circumstances, the north-south or meridional wind speed) over a range of      
altitudes, especially ones above the cloud tops. These latter estimates are   
subject to the joint caveats of certain dynamical assumptions (e.g.,          
geostrophic balance, which breaks down near the equator, or cyclostrophic     
balance, which breaks down near the poles) and the need to have independent   
estimates of wind speed at some reference altitude (e.g., the cloud tops)     
(Seiff et al., 1980). Wind speeds obtained from Probe tracking are valuable   
both in their own right (see below) and for providing 'ground-truth' for      
remote sensing techniques. With regards to the latter, Probe-derived winds    
help to define the average altitude to which the feature tracked winds pertain
and help to test the accuracy of winds found from measured temperature fields.
     Because of Venus' proximity to the Earth, it has proved possible to      
obtain both accurate Doppler shift and angular displacement measurements of   
the time-varying positions of entry Probes and balloons. As a result, it was  
possible to determine the three-dimensional velocity field of the winds       
(especially, the usually much larger horizontal wind speeds) (e.g., Counselman
et al., 1980; Preston et al., 1986). Unfortunately in the case of the Galileo 
Probe, it is possible only to measure the Doppler shift of the Probe's        
telemetry, but not its angular displacement, as a result of the much greater  
distance of Jupiter from the Earth and the Probe's antenna being pointed at   
the Orbiter (which puts the Earth in the distant lobes of the Probe's         
telemetry antenna). Nevertheless, the Doppler data can yield some very        
important and unique information on the variation of the zonal wind speed with
altitude over a pressure range from about 100 mb to about 20 bars. The probe  
is expected to traverse the atmosphere at approximately 6.5 degrees north,    
which lies well within Jupiter's equatorial jet.                              
     In principle, all three wind speed components as well as the Probe's     
descent velocity and the Orbiter's motion can contribute to the observed      
Doppler shift. However, the Probe's descent velocity will be determined very  
accurately from analysis of temperature and pressure measurements made by the 
atmospheric structure experiment and the Orbiter's motion can be extremely    
accurately determined from other data. Among the three wind components, the   
zonal speed is expected to be the dominant contributor to the measured        
frequency shift in all, but the most pathological cases for the following     
reasons: (1) The projection of the Probe/Orbiter line of sight onto the local 
horizontal plane of Jupiter lies almost in an east-west direction, except at  
times very close to overflight. (2) At the level of the visible cloud layer,  
zonal wind speeds are typically more than an order of magnitude larger than   
the meridional wind speed, including at the latitude of the Galileo Probe     
(Ingersoll et al., 1981). (3) It is easy to show from the continuity equation 
that the vertical wind speeds associated with the large-scale zonal wind      
speeds near the cloud tops are more than three orders of magnitude smaller    
than the horizontal wind speeds (Holton, 1979). However, vertical velocities  
associated with thermal convection driven by the internal heat source can have
somewhat larger values in the deeper portions of the atmosphere that will be  
examined by the Galileo Probe experiments (Gierasch, 1976). Thus, it would be 
possible to retrieve the vertical profile of the zonal wind speed from the    
time-varying frequency of the Probe's telemetry signal.                       
     Differences in the amount of sunlight absorbed at different latitudes    
provides the basic drive for the winds in the atmospheres of the terrestrial  
planets. However, a much wider suite of potential drives exists for the Jovian
winds. They may be driven principally by differential solar heating, latent   
heat released by condensing water vapor, heat being advected upwards from the 
deep, hot interior, or heat generated from ortho/para transitions of molecular
hydrogen (Stone, 1967; Gierasch, 1976; Ingersoll and Pollard, 1982; Conrath   
and Gierasch, 1984). Below, we briefly review the nature of these different   
drives and present schematic profiles of zonal winds that might result from   
each of them.                                                                 
     The magnitude of Jupiter's internal heat source is nearly comparable to  
the amount of sunlight that the planet absorbs (Hanel et al., 1981). The      
thermal convective heat flux associated with this internal heat source almost 
totally compensates for the global-scale variation in absorbed sunlight from  
equator to pole so that the amount of thermal radiation emitted to space is   
almost constant on this length scale (Ingersoll and Porco, 1978).             
Consequently, no significant global-scale temperature gradient results from   
differential absorption of sunlight and hence no significant global-scale     
circulation pattern can result from this drive, contrary to some pre-Pioneer  
models of Jovian dynamics (e.g., Stone, 1967). Nevertheless, this compensating
effect of the interior heat flux does not occur on smaller length scales: the 
difference in the thermal radiation emitted by adjacent belts and zones is    
somewhat larger than the non-trivial difference in the amount of sunlight they
absorb (Pirraglia, 1984). Consequently. differential solar heating could be an
important drive for wind systems having length scales on the order of the     
bands.                                                                        
     Significant absorption of sunlight occurs near the level of the          
uppermost, optically thick cloud layer, a putative ammonia ice cloud deck,    
whose bottom lies near the 700 mb level. This cloud layer typically has an    
optical depth of several and a non-unit single-scattering albedo in the       
visible (West et al., 1986). Additional absorption of sunlight takes place in 
the lower stratosphere (1-100 mb) due to gases (especially methane) and       
aerosols and at greater depths in the troposphere due to gases and other cloud
particles. According to the calculations of Hunten et al. (1980), almost all  
the solar energy absorbed by Jupiter's atmosphere is deposited at altitudes   
above the 2 bar pressure level. Therefore, we approximate the winds resulting 
from differential solar heating as having a maximum slightly below the ammonia
cloud deck and tending towards zero near the 2 bar level (cf. Figure 1; P.    
Gierasch, private communication).                                             
     On the length scale of the Jovian bands, the cloud-top winds are         
approximately in geostrophic balance, i.e., the basic balance in the          
meridional momentum equation is between the Coriolis force and the            
pressure-gradient force (e.g., Gierasch, 1976). Consequently, the thermal wind
equation can be used to place a constraint on the magnitude of the temperature
difference between belts and zones that is needed to produce the observed     
zonal winds. This temperature difference scales inversely with the depth of   
the source region for the winds. For winds being driven by latent heat that is
released by water vapor condensing near the 7 bar level of the atmosphere, the
required temperature difference is comparable to the difference expected from 
wet and dry adiabats for solar abundances of water (Gierasch, 1976). Thus,    
this type of model envisions that water preferentially condenses in regions of
large-scale rising motion. In this sense, the latent heat drive strongly      
reinforces any small differential rising and sinking motions. Note that       
although almost all the water condensation occurs within a fraction of a scale
height of the water cloud base, the temperature difference between wet and dry
adiabats persists throughout the convectively unstable region lying above the 
water cloud base. We represent the winds resulting from the latent heat drive 
as beginning at the base of the water clouds and reaching their maximum near  
the top of the convection zone (cf. Figure 1; P. Gierasch, private            
communication).

     Temperature differences on constant pressure surfaces in the convective  
region of the Jovian troposphere can also be produced by horizontal variations
in the relative abundance of molecular hydrogen in its ortho and para states  
(Gierasch, 1983). Since the specific heat at constant pressure of these two   
states of hydrogen differ, variations in the ortho to para ratio lead to      
variations in the adiabatic lapse rate and hence temperature. As the          
interconversion of ortho and para hydrogen is spin forbidden, it is expected  
to take place slowly in the colder, upper region of the Jovian troposphere    
(Massie and Hunten, 1982). In fact, there is evidence from the Voyager IRIS   
data that significant horizontal variations in the ortho to para ratio exist  
in the uppermost troposphere (Conrath and Gierasch, 1984). However, analysis  
of ground-based spectra implies that only equilibrium hydrogen is present at  
deeper levels of the Jovian atmosphere (Cunningham et al., 1988).             
    The wind profile in Figure 1 associated with horizontal variations in the 
ortho/para ratio was obtained by assuming that extreme differences in this    
ratio occur in neighboring bands, that temperature gradients vanish at great  
depths in the troposphere and at stratospheric altitudes, and that the        
circulation extends fairly deep within the troposphere (Glerasch, 1983). Thus,
like all the other profiles in Figure 1, the one shown for an ortho/para drive
is simply meant to be one plausible example of this class of dynamical model. 
     In all the above models, the drive for the circulation is located at     
relatively shallow depths in a very deep molecular hydrogen envelope for the  
planet. An alternative viewpoint is to consider a much deeper circulation     
pattern that persists throughout the molecular hydrogen envelope and that is  
driven by the internal heat source (Ingersoll and Pollard, 1982). Theoretical 
and laboratory studies show that columnar convection cells, aligned with the  
spin axis, are the preferred mode of convective instability in rapidly and    
uniformly rotating, viscous, conducting fluids (e.g., Busse, 1976). A somewhat
more generalized state of motion involves cylindrical cells that interact with
a basic cylindrical, differential rotation to produce zonal winds near the top
of the adiabatic portion of the fluid (Ingersoll and Pollard, 1982). We       
crudely represent the zonal wind profile for this type of model as having a   
modest wind shear throughout the region measured by the Galileo Probe and as  
having a non-zero velocity at the base of this region (cf. Figure 1; P.       
Gierasch, private communication).                                             
    According to Figure 1, the 'representative' zonal wind profiles associated
with the four dynamical models differ substantially from one another. Thus,   
one might hope to distinguish among them by comparing their predictions with  
zonal wind profiles derived from the Galileo Probe's telemetry frequency.     
However, there is a significant variance possible in the wind profiles        
corresponding to each of the dynamical models. Conceivably, data taken by a   
variety of Galileo Probe and Orbiter experiments will lead to well-constrained
predictions for these various models in the post-Galileo era. For the purposes
of this paper, we merely wish to show that winds can be recovered with        
sufficient accuracy from the Galileo Doppler wind experiment to provide useful
constraints on the underlying drives for the winds. We also recognize that    
winds associated with eddy motions may contribute to the derived wind profile,
although eddy wind speeds in the Jovian atmosphere are typically almost an    
order of magnitude smaller than the zonally average zonal wind speed near the 
cloud tops (Ingersoll et al., 1981).                                          
     Given the experience in deriving wind speeds from Doppler data for probes
into Venus' atmosphere and given the well-known and relatively simple form of 
the Doppler equation, it might be thought that its application to the Galileo 
Probe would be quite straightforward. However, this is not the case for       
several reasons. First, the geometry of the Probe and Orbiter positions       
changes significantly during the communication period. In particular, the     
angle between the line of sight of the probe and orbiter and the local        
vertical (probe aspect angle), which determines the contribution of horizontal
wind speeds to the Doppler shift, varies from essentially 0 degrees at        
overflight to values that approach 10 degrees near the beginning and end of   
the communication period. As shown in the next section, such variations both  
complicate the analysis of the Doppler data and open up opportunities (e.g.,  
it is possible to recover absolute wind speeds without knowing well the       
oscillators' zero-point frequency).                                           
     A second reason that the analysis of the Galileo Probe Doppler data is   
less than straightforward is the need to do careful study of a wide range of  
possible error sources that make deriving winds for Jupiter's atmosphere more 
problematic than was the case for Venus' atmosphere. Except very close to the 
surface of Venus, the zonal wind speeds are much larger than the speed of the 
planet's solid body rotation. In contrast, Jupiter's rotational velocity near 
its equator has a value of approximately 10 km s^-1 which is about two orders 
of magnitude larger than the measured zonal wind speed near the ammonia cloud 
tops. Consequently, small inaccuracies in the a posteriori knowledge of the   
Probe's location might seriously compromise the ability to derive accurate    
relative wind speeds from the Doppler shift data. Other aspects of the        
spacecraft geometry and Jovian environment also make the retrieval of accurate
wind speeds more challenging than was the case for Venus. These include the   
small values of the Probe aspect angle and the strong Jovian magnetosphere    
(the high flux of high-energy particles can cause drifts in the Orbiter and   
Probe oscillators). Despite this highly unfavorable situation for performing  
Doppler wind measurements, we will show that accurate wind retrievals are     
possible.                                                                     
     In the next section of this paper, we describe the mathematical basis of 
our approach that begins with the relativistic Doppler shift equation and     
reduces it down to the solution of a set of linearized equations. In the      
subsequent section, we investigate the effects of a large number of possible  
error sources that limit the accuracy in the recovered winds and provide      
estimates of their magnitudes. Next, we present full-up simulations of our    
approach by attempting to recover the four classes of wind profiles given in  
Figure 1 in the presence of realistic errors in the data and our knowledge of 
critical parameters. Finally, we summarize the conclusions of this paper by   
assessing the accuracy with which a wind profile can be retrieved from the    
Galileo Probe's telemetry frequency, key sources of error, and the ability of 
the retrieved profiles to discriminate among the major candidate drives of the
circulation.                                                                  
                                                                              
                                   2. Approach                                
                                                                              
     Beginning at about the 100 mb level in the atmosphere, when the Galileo  
Probe's descent velocity has become subsonic and its parachute systems have   
been deployed, the Probe's radio system will send telemetry signals to the    
Orbiter's radio system. This communication will last approximately 60 min, at 
which point the probe will have descended to about the 20 bar level in the    
Jovian atmosphere. The Probe's telemetry will be sent by two independent      
channels to help ensure the successful receipt of the results from the Probe  
experiments. One of these channels is controlled by an ultra-stable oscillator
(USO) on the Probe. An identical USO on the Orbiter will provide a highly     
accurate measurement of the frequency of the carrier, f, whose nominal value  
is 1387 MHz. The received frequency will be measured every 2/3 s during the   
Probe/Orbiter relay link. We suppose for the moment that the contributions to 
the Doppler shift from all sources other than the atmospheric winds can be    
removed exactly, we consider only the effects of the zonal component of the   
winds for reasons given in the Introduction, and we use the classical form of 
the Doppler shift equation for planar geometry                                
                                                                              
          f_o = f_p + f^mis + f_p  U/c sin psi cos alpha,                     
                                                                              
where f_o is the received frequency at the Orbiter, f_p is the transmitted    
frequency at the Probe, f^mis is the Doppler shift due to all factors other   
than the zonal wind speed, U is the zonal wind speed, c is the speed of light,
psi is the angle between the local vertical and the line of sight between the 
Probe and Orbiter, and alpha is the angle between the east-west direction and 
the projection of the line of sight on the local horizontal plane. The product
sin psi cos alpha is simply the fraction of U that lies along the line of     
sight.                                                                        
     Unfortunately, there are large uncertainties in the zero-point frequency 
of the Probe and Orbiter's oscillators. While the USOs are quite stable over  
the period of the communication link, they are expected to undergo a          
significant drift over the 6 to 7 year cruise interval from launch to arrival 
at Jupiter. Since there will be no 2 way links between the ground and the USOs
following launch, there is no procedure for accurately determining the actual 
long-term drift. Ground-based tests that have been conducted on the USOs      
suggest that they may drift by about 500 Hz during the cruise period. A drift 
of this magnitude is equivalent to the Doppler shift produced by a 1000 m s^-1
zonal wind for the geometry of the Galileo mission!                           
     The solution to the problem posed by the large uncertainty in the USOs'  
zero-point frequency is to use differences in the measured frequencies:       
                                                                              
delta f_o - delta f^mis =                                                     
                                                                              
f_p (delta[U])/c sin psi cos alpha + f_p U/c delta(sin psi cos alpha),        
                                                                              
where delta x means the difference in the value of parameter x at any time t  
during the relay link and some reference time, t_r. The left-hand side of the 
above equation contains a combination of the measured frequencies, now having 
a high accuracy, and Doppler shifts due to a variety of well-measured or known
velocities. According to the above equation, the zonal velocity affects the   
measured frequency difference in two ways: through changes in zonal wind speed
with depth in the atmosphere and through the changing geometry of the line of 
sight, as influenced by the time-integrated effect of the wind on the Probe's 
position.                                                                     
     Figure 2 shows the variation of psi and alpha as a function of time after
entry for the nominal Probe mission, with Orbiter overflight of the Probe     
occurring 21 min after Probe entry. The geometrical factors change            
significantly over the course of the relay link, making the magnitude of the  
second term on the right-hand side of the above equation comparable to or     
greater than that of the first term during much of the relay link. As a       
result, it is possible in principle to determine absolute wind speeds as well 
as wind shears from measured frequency differences.                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 2. Probe and Orbiter longitudes, Probe aspect angle (psi), azimuth angle 
(alpha), and projection factor (fraction of the zonal wind projected onto the 
line of sight) as function of time from the Galileo Probe's entry into the    
Jovian atmosphere.                                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
     However, the above equation cannot be readily inverted to yield wind     
speeds directly. This last point is brought out even more clearly when it is  
realized that the winds significantly alter the longitudinal location of the  
probe (in a time-integrated fashion) and therefore significantly affect the   
values of the angular quantities appearing in these equations, as verified by 
our detailed calculations. For these reasons, we will perform a number of     
transformations on the Doppler shift equation, beginning with the more        
rigorous relativistic counterpart of the above equation, to reduce the problem
to a set of linearized equations that can be solved with least-squares        
techniques.                                                                   
     In more detail, the derivation of the final linearized set of equations  
given below follows the following path: (1) The full relativistic Doppler     
equation is expanded to second-order in velocity. (2) We express the resulting
equation as an equality between the measured Doppler shift and accurately     
known quantities on one side of the equation and the velocity along the line  
of sight on the other side of the equation. (3) This velocity is expanded     
about a state of zero horizontal wind speed. This expansion is useful since   
the horizontal wind speeds are much less than the planet's rotational         
velocity. (4) The horizontal wind speed's dependence on atmospheric pressure  
is expressed as a Legendre polynomial expansion. This expansion is needed     
since the Doppler shift depends, in part, on the time integral of the wind    
speed, which affects the instantaneous location of the Probe (cf. Equation    
(2)). (5) The problem at this point has been reduced to a linear least-squares
problem involving the coefficients of the Legendre polynomials. The singular  
value decomposition method is used to invert the relevant equations, reduce   
them to a form required by standard least-squares techniques, and insure good 
numerical stability.                                                          
   Since the magnitude of the relative velocity between the Probe and Orbiter,
V_tot is much less than the speed-of-light, c, we can use a Taylor series     
expansion on the full relativistic Doppler shift equation and retain terms    
only up to order 1/c^2 (Kerzhanovich et al., 1969; Paper I). The resulting    
equation is given by                                                          
                                                                              
f_o - f_p = - (f_p/c) [V_parallel + 1/c ((V_tot^2/2) - V_parallel^2) - cG_r], 
                                                                              
where V_parallel, is the projection of V_tot along the line of sight between  
the Probe and Orbiter and G_r is the general relativistic red shift in the    
weak field limit (Paper I). The first term on the right-hand side of this     
equation is the familiar classical Doppler shift term. Our sign convention in 
this equation and the ones below is that a positive value of V_parallel       
implies an increasing distance between the Probe and Orbiter and, hence, a red
shift to the measured frequency.                                              
     The gravitational red shift has a value of approximately 20.5 Hz for the 
nominal distances of the Probe and Orbiter from the center of Jupiter.        
However, it changes by only a few tenths of a Hz during the relay link and    
even this relatively trivial effect can be removed to very high accuracy. The 
second term on the right-hand side of the equation has a magnitude of several 
tens of Hz and varies by about this much over the relay link. Since a zonal   
wind speed of 1 m s^-1 produces a Doppler shift that averages about 0.5 Hz    
over the relay link, these higher-order terms are important and must be taken 
into account in the ultimate analysis. Fortunately, these higher-order terms  
are dominated by the projections of the Orbiter's motion and the planet's     
rotational velocity along the line of sight and, hence, these terms can be    
evaluated with high accuracy from the start of the inversion procedure.       
     We rewrite the relativistic Doppler shift equation with 'knowns' on the  
left-hand side of the equation and the unknowns on the right-hand side:       
                                                                              
f_Dop' = -f_p (V_parallel/c)                                                  
                                                                              
f_Dop' = f_o - f_p(1 + G_r) - 1/c^2 [(V_tot^2/2) - V_parallel^2].             
                                                                              
We next cast the above equation in terms of the difference in the Doppler     
shift at an arbitrary time, t, during the relay link and some reference time, 
t_r:                                                                          
                                                                              
delta f_Dop' = -f_p ( delta V_parallel/c)                                     
                                                                              
Here, as earlier, delta x means the difference in the value of x at time t and
its value at time t_r.                                                        
     It is useful at this point to introduce a spherical-coordinate system    
whose origin lies at the center of Jupiter, as illustrated in Figure 3. The   
positions of the Probe and Orbiter

Various basic angles used in the text are defined in this figure.             
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
are specified by a radial distance r from the origin and colatitudes theta and
longitudes phi. Auxiliary angles in this coordinate system include gamma, the 
angle between the direction to the Probe and Orbiter, as measured from the    
origin, psi, the Probe aspect angle, and alpha, the line-of-sight azimuth. The
mathematical relationships between the auxiliary angles gamma, psi, and alpha 
and the primary spherical coordinates and between V_parallel and these        
primary coordinates are given in Paper I.                                     
     It is useful to write V_parallel in terms of a Taylor series expansion   
of the spherical coordinates and their time derivatives both to obtain a      
linear set of equations for the zonal wind velocities and to provide a        
mathematical basis for performing the error analysis discussed in the next    
section. For our present purposes, we will assume that all the relative       
motions contributing to V_parallel are either known with negligible           
uncertainties or are unimportant, except for the zonal wind speed. In this    
case, only the coordinate phi_p and its time derivative enter into the second 
term on the right-hand side of the Taylor-series expansion. We obtain the     
following linearized equations for the zonal wind speed, U, in terms of the   
measured Doppler shift and other, known velocities:

where delta x_i is the difference between the true of x_i and the value       
determined from the best available information (e.g., Probe descent velocity,

     As a final step in linearizing the equation relating measured and known  
quantities to the unknown zonal wind speed, we express the zonal wind speed in
terms of an Nth order expansion in Legendre polynomials:

             log(pr(t)) - log(pr(t_r))

where P_l is a Legendre polynomial of order l, pr is the atmospheric pressure 
at the Probe's location, and subscripts r and f denote the times of the first 
(or reference) and last Doppler shift data. The unknowns now are the constants
a_l.                                                                          
     Finally, we combine the above two sets of equations to obtain a matrix   
equation for the unknowns, a_l, which we now write as a vector "a" to simplify
the notation:

vector a has L elements ( = N + 1), corresponding to the number of terms used 
in the Legendre polynomial representation of the wind speed; vector b has M   
elements, corresponding to the number of discrete time points, t_m, at which  
the measurements are made (or a subset that have been appropriately time      
averaged over small time segments); matrix C is of dimension M by L, as are   
matrices beta_1 and beta_2. In the above equations, delta_t is the time       
between successive samples. There are many more time points, M, than          
unknowns, L.                                                                  
     In principle.the above matrix equation could be solved by simply         
multiplying the equation by C^-1 on the left side of both sides of the        
equation, where C^-1 is the inverse of matrix C. In practice, such a procedure
is susceptible to numerical problems that arise when dealing with matrices    
that may be nearly singular. For this reason. we express C in terms of the    
product of three matrices, U, W, and V, in accord with the method of singular 
value decomposition (Golub and Van Loan, 1983). The resultant equation for a  
is then (Paper I):                                                            
                                                                              
     a = [VW^-1U^T]b,                                                         
                                                                              
where superscripts -1 and T means the inverse and transpose of a matrix,      
respectively. Given a set of values of b_m (m = 1 to M), obtained from Doppler
shift measurements and the removal of well-measured values of velocity        
components other than the zonal wind speed, one can obtain a best estimate of 
the zonal wind speed coefficients a_l, (l = 0 to N) by using standard         
least-squares techniques for solving the above matrix equation.               
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                3. Error Analysis                             
                                                                              
     There are a very large number of factors that can influence the measured 
Doppler shift. In this section, we determine the uncertainties in the         
knowledge of all factors aside from the zonal wind profile and their impact on
the measured Doppler shift to ascertain the feasibility and limitations on    
recovering the zonal wind profile in Jupiter's atmosphere from the frequency  
of the Probe's telemetry signal. In the next section of this paper, we will   
provide quantitative estimates of the errors in the zonal wind speed profile  
due to the cumulative effects of the uncertainties in the a posteriori        
knowledge of all the relevant factors that affect the Doppler shift.          
     It is useful to place the factors of interest into several broad         
categories. These categories include the trajectories of the Probe and Orbiter
during the relay link, as specified in terms of the six basic variables and   
their time derivatives; factors that influence the frequency of the USOs;     
propagation effects that influence the phase path of the Probe's signal; and a
variety of miscellaneous factors that include such quantities as the effects  
of special and general relativity. In the discussion below, we emphasize those
factors that can potentially generate the largest errors in the recovered     
winds.                                                                        
     As formulated in the previous section, the primary variable used to      
determine the zonal wind speed profile is the difference in the frequency of  
the Probe's signal at some arbitrary time t during the relay link and that    
measured at some fixed reference time, t_r, that we take to be the first such 
measurement. These frequency determinations are made by a USO on the Galileo  
Orbiter. Thus, factors that cause a time-independent alteration of the        
measured frequency ('constant' errors) will have no effect on the recovered   
winds. Rather systematic distortions to the recovered winds can be introduced 
by factors that cause a time-varying error in the measured frequency. Here, we
distinguish between time-varying errors having a consistent trend during the  
link ('systematic' errors) and ones having a random or periodic nature on time
scales short compared to the duration of the relay link ('random' errors). We 
emphasize that it is only the uncertainty in the values of the various factors
subsequent to the relay link that are of interest: we intend to remove the    
influence of all factors from the measured frequency difference to the degree 
that their values are known and their impact can be appropriately modeled.    
     The influence of the zonal winds on the measured frequencies provides a  
convenient standard for assessing the importance of various error sources.    
Over the course of the relay link, the internal heat wind model of Figure 1   
produces approximately a 100 Hz shift in the measured frequency due to the    
wind's effect on (phi_p)dot and about 100 Hz in the measured frequency due to 
its effect on phi_p. Comparable shifts apply to the other wind models of      
Figure 1. Thus, factors that produce time-varying errors in frequency of 100  
Hz or more, 10-100, 1-10, and < 1 Hz would have lethal, serious, non-trivial, 
and very minor impacts, respectively. on the recovered winds.                 
     Finally, the measured frequency differences are linked to the cumulative 
effects of winds at all earlier times as a result of the changing geometry of 
the observations (cf. Equations (7)-(10)). As a result of this relationship   
and our use of a least-squares solution algorithm, it is possible to recover  
winds near the beginning of the relay link with comparable accuracy to those  
towards the end, despite our use of the initial frequency measurement as our  
reference frequency. This claim will be demonstrated when we show the         
frequency residuals of simulated cases.                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
                        3.1. TRAJECTORY UNCERTAINTIES                         
                                                                              
     Several sets of observations will provide an accurate determination of   
variables that define the positions and velocities of the Probe and Orbiter,  
aside from the horizontal winds. These include Earth-based tracking of the    
Orbiter's position prior to, during, and following the relay link;            
reconstructions of the Probe's trajectory following its release from the      
Orbiter and, hence, its entry location in Jupiter's atmosphere that are based 
on careful tracking of the Orbiter's location around the time of Probe        
release; determination of the Probe's descent velocity from data obtained by  
several Probe experiments. notably the Atmospheric Structure Instrument (ASI);
and current knowledge of the planet's solid body rotation rate and its figure.
As we will shortly see, errors in the descent velocity and Probe entry        
location, especially its entry longitude, constitute by far the most important
error sources among the ones listed above and these are among the largest     
error sources of all the factors. We, therefore, begin our discussion by      
focusing on these two error sources.                                          
     The descent velocity, (r_p)dot, will be derived from frequent            
measurements of pressure, P, and temperature, T, made by the ASI experiment by
using the following equation:                                                 
                                                                              
                 RT        dP                                                 
(r_p)dot = - ----------  ------  ,                                            
               g mu P      dt                                                 
                                                                              
where R is the universal gas constant, g is the acceleration of gravity, and  
mu is the mean molecular weight of the atmospheric gases (Seiff et al., 1980).
This equation is based on the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and the     
perfect gas law, relationships that should be obeyed very closely in the      
region of the Jovian atmosphere of interest. To evaluate the uncertainty in   
(r_p)dot, we consider errors arising from each of the four variables in       
Equation (19).                                                                
     Very accurate values of g (to better than 1 part in 10^4) may be obtained
from Jupiter's mass, its radius at the 100 mb pressure level as a function of 
latitude, and the Probe's position relative to the 100 mb pressure level. The 
first two of these variables are currently known to a very high accuracy from 
past spacecraft missions to Jupiter, while the third variable can be inferred 
from the data of ASI (from (r_p)dot in a slightly iterative fashion). The mean
molecular weight, mu, is expected to be measured to a relative accuracy of 2  
parts in 10^3 by the Helium Abundance Experiment of the Galileo Probe. This   
uncertainty makes a non-trivial contribution to the overall uncertainty in the
values of (r_p)dot derived from the above equation.                           
     It is useful to partition the errors in P and T into scale factor, zero  
point or offset, and random errors (Seiff et al., 1989). An extensive set of  
calibration tests of ASI indicate that the scale factor, offset, and random   
errors in the temperature measurements will be approximately 0.002, 0.15, and 
0.087 K, respectively. Scale factor errors in pressure do not affect (r_p)dot.
Offset and random errors in pressure vary among three intervals of pressure   
values spanned by the separate sensors of the ASI, but typically correspond to
fractional errors of 0.002 and 0.001, respectively.                           
     Collectively, the errors in pressure, temperature, and mean molecular    
weight produce scale, offset, and random fractional errors in the inferred    
descent velocity of about 0.002, 0.0035, and 0.0016, respectively. When these 
separate components are combined in a root sum square fashion (RSS), a typical
total fractional error in the descent velocity of about 0.0043 results. Thus, 
when the descent velocity is 50 m s^-1, as occurs at about the 5 bar pressure 
level, the corresponding uncertainty in this value would be about 0.2 m s^-1. 
Such an uncertainty may not seem to be very significant -- indeed it          
represents a real triumph in measurement accuracy! However, it is non-trivial 
since almost all of the descent velocity lies along the line of sight between 
the Probe and Orbiter and only about 0.1 of the zonal wind speed projects     
along the line of sight. Thus, errors in descent velocity can cause an order  
of magnitude larger error in the recovered zonal wind speed.                  
     Table I summarizes the effects of the errors in the inferred descent     
velocity, (r_p)dot by giving the resulting constant, systematic, and random   
errors in the measured frequency. A priori errors refer to ones expected in   
the absence of relevant data (e.g., measurements of the descent velocity by   
the Probe's ASI experiment) or the use of ground-based calibration data, while
a posteriori errors refer to ones remaining after such information is         
employed. Thus, the magnitude of the a priori error provides an indication of 
the need to partially correct it, if possible, while the difference between   
the a priori and a posteriori errors show the degree to which the former can  
be eliminated. Table I also gives the corresponding errors due to a large     
number of other factors, most of which will be discussed in the remainder of  
this section.                                                                 
     Another important error results from the uncertainty in the entry        
location of the Probe. Its trajectory can be reconstructed accurately from a  
knowledge of its relative velocity to the Orbiter at the time of separation,  
the Orbiter's trajectory, and the laws of celestial mechanics. (Note that the 
Probe does not have any active propulsion system.) The Probe release dynamics 
can be calculated by tracking the Orbiter prior to, during, and after Probe   
release, since the Probe's relative momentum at release is equal and opposite 
to the change in momentum of the Orbiter at release.                          
     Table II provides our current estimates of the 1 sigma uncertainties in  
the entry parameters for the Probe that result from uncertainties in the      
Orbiter's trajectory. Of these errors, the most important one is the          
uncertainty in the entry longitude of the Probe, since it produces a          
non-trivial error in the angle between the zonal direction and the line of    
sight. Figure 4(a) shows the change in relay link frequency near the start of 
the link as a function of the uncertainty in the entry longitude, delta phi_p.
For the uncertainty in entry longitude given in Table II, there is a resulting
uncertainty of almost 100 Hz in relay link frequency. The uncertainty in the  
entry longitude arises almost entirely from uncertainties in the time interval
between Probe release from the Orbiter and entry into the Jovian atmosphere.  
delta phi_p strongly affects the analysis of the relay link frequency because 
of the error it causes in the projection of the planet's rotational velocity  
(which is shared by the Probe) along the line of sight. Fortunately, as       
illustrated in Figure 4(b), the impact of the entry longitude on the relay    
link frequency difference, the primary quantity used in our analysis, is      
considerably smaller than its impact on the absolute frequency. As summarized 
in Table I, there still results a systematic error of about 8 Hz in the       
frequency difference, making the error in Probe entry longitude perhaps the   
single most important source of error in the recovered winds.                 
     The Orbiter's trajectory during the relay link will be known to a very   
high degree of accuracy as a result of its being continually tracked by a     
series of techniques. The Orbiter's location and velocity will be determined  
from Earth-based Doppler tracking, ranging (signal propagation time), and     
angular position measurements made with a Differential Very Long Baseline     
Interferometer. Reconstruction of the Orbiter's trajectory will include       
allowance for stochastic accelerations due to spacecraft venting, gas leaks,  
and attitude reorientation maneuvers.                                         
     Table III summarizes the estimated 1 sigma errors in the position and    
velocity of the Orbiter during the Probe relay link and their associated      
frequency errors. As can be seen,

"a" At time of Probe entry.                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
these errors are extremely small. Furthermore. these values are primarily     
constant errors and so the systematic errors associated with the uncertainties
in the Orbiter trajectory would be much smaller (cf. Table I).                
     Uncertainties in the planet's solid body rotational velocity introduce   
errors in the absolute zonal wind speeds, i.e., the zero point of the wind    
speeds. They arise from two sources: the uncertainty in the planet's solid    
body rotation rate and the uncertainty in the Probe's distance from the       
planet's center. We assume that the planet's interior rotates at the same rate
as the magnetic field. The fractional uncertainty of 10^-6 in the period of   
system III (Smith and West, 1982) produces an uncertainty in the planet's     
rotational velocity of about 1 cm s^-1 which is negligible compared to many   
other error sources.                                                          
     A larger uncertainty in the value of the rotational velocity results from
the uncertainty in the radial distance of the Probe from the center of        
Jupiter. By combining occultation profiles obtained by the Voyager and Pioneer
spacecraft, Lindal et al. (1981) have determined the gravitational            
equipotential surface of Jupiter at the 100 mb level. Based on the goodness of
fit of the individual measurements to the proposed zenoid, the uncertainty in 
the radius of the 100 mb pressure level at the Probe's location will be +-4   
km. This uncertainty produces a 0.6 m s^-1 uncertainty in the planet's        
rotational velocity at this level.

     In addition to this constant error, there will also be a small systematic
error in the rotational velocity due to errors in deriving the altitude       
separation between the 100 mb level and some deeper level, based on the ASI   
data. By the end of the relay link, the error in this altitude separation may 
reach about 0.05 km. Such an error produces a systematic error in velocity of 
about 0.9 cm s^-1, which is negligibly small compared to other error sources. 
     Finally, two small changes in the measured frequency arise from the      
Probe's spin. First, the deliberate misalignment of the Probe's antenna and   
its spin axis results in a periodically varying velocity of the antenna along 
the line of sight and, hence, a periodic modulation of the measured frequency 
that depends on the spin rate, distance of the antenna from the central axis, 
and its offset angle. As shown in Table 1, a frequency modulation (peak to    
peak) of about 0.2 Hz results for a nominal spin rate of 5 rpm. The magnitude 
of this modulation is proportional to the spin rate and has a period equal to 
the spin rate. Conceivably by appropriately filtering the measured frequency, 
we may be able to recover the spin rate as a function of time during descent  
(it will vary slowly). Since the Probe's antenna transmits circularly         
polarized signals, the transmitted frequency is slightly altered by the       
antenna's rotation (Paper I). The observed frequency is shifted by an amount  
equal to the spin rate (0.08 Hz for the nominal rate).                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.2. OSCILLATOR ERRORS                                                        
                                                                              
     Much effort has been expended in constructing extremely stable           
oscillators for use on the Probe and Orbiter, in shielding them, and in       
calibrating their behavior, especially for frequency shifts induced by a      
variety of environmental factors. As a result, frequency drifts of the USOs on
the Probe and Orbiter should not seriously compromise the retrieval of winds  
from the Doppler data (indeed, this experiment influenced the design of the   
USOs), but these drifts can still have some effect on the accuracy of the     
retrieved winds. Here, we first summarize pertinent characteristics of the    
USOs and then enumerate the drifts they can undergo due to a variety of       
factors, with emphasis on the largest drifts.                                 
     The heart of the USO is an 'SC' cut quartz crystal that is extremely     
stable in its resonance frequency and that is much less sensitive to          
g-loading, thermal disturbances, and radiation than the 'AT' cut used on the  
Voyager spacecraft. Furthermore, the Galileo crystals have been radiation     
hardened by exposure to a one Mrad dose of gamma rays from a cobalt-60 source 
to minimize their susceptibility to radiation-induced drifts. The housing for 
the crystal includes a double-insulated temperature control oven to maintain a
highly stable operating temperature. The Orbiter USO is identical in terms of 
the crystal and its housing to the Probe USO.                                 
     Various environmental factors and the intrinsic properties of the USOs   
will cause their frequencies to change by small, but not totally trivial      
amounts over the course of the relay link. A series of calibration tests on   
the flight USOs have provided estimates of the magnitudes of these drifts as  
well as calibration curves that will enable them to be partially modeled,     
thereby reducing somewhat their impact on the wind recovery. As shown in Table
I, the separate and the cumulative errors due to time variations of pressure, 
temperature, bus voltage, acceleration, and orientation of the magnetic field 
produce very small systematic errors in the Probe's carrier frequency.        
     Even in the absence of all known perturbations, the frequency of the     
oscillators will undergo some small drift in frequency. These effects are     
referred to as 'aging'. The calibration tests indicate that the USOs undergo  
secular frequency drifts of 0.6 Hz over a 30-min period, with an uncertainty  
of 0.14 Hz (Paper I). On much shorter time scales, the frequency experiences  
random variations of approximately 0.003 Hz ('Allen variance').               
     Jovian magnetospheric particles can alter the secular drift rate of the  
frequency of the Probe and Orbiter's USOs, thereby degrading the Doppler wind 
experiment. Figure 5(a) shows an estimate of the radiation dose rate (mostly  
bremsstrahlung X-rays) that the Probe's USO will experience as it passes      
through the inner magnetosphere on its way to the planet. This figure was     
derived from an empirical model of the Jovian magnetosphere, based on data    
from the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft (e.g., Armstrong et al., 1981; Galileo
Project, 1982), the nominal Probe trajectory, and the shielding provided by   
the spacecraft and oscillator housing (P. Garcia, private communication).     
Since the radiation is highest in the equatorial plane of the magnetic field, 
which is tilted

by 11.5 degrees to the rotational equatorial plane, the actual radiation seen 
by the probe will vary sinusoidally with time. The curve labelled 'nominal' in
Figure 5(a) refers to conditions that have been averaged over system III      
longitude, while 'worst case' shows the dose rate for system III longitudes   
that place the Probe closest to the magnetic equator.                         
     According to Figure 5(a), the Probe's USO experiences a maximum dose rate
of about 1.4 rad s^-1 at 2 R_J from the planet's center, which occurs about 50
min before entry, where R_J is the planet's equatorial radius. A somewhat     
smaller, but more time constant dose rate will be experienced by the Orbiter's
USO, which will be located at about 4.0 R_J during the relay link.            
     In 1981, calibration tests were performed on the flight USOs to determine
the effect of radiation on their frequency. Of greatest interest was the      
alteration to the secular drift rate of this frequency. The tests were        
performed following radiation hardening. They involved exposing the USOs to   
gamma rays from a cobalt-60 source. In the case of the Probe's USO, the dose  
rate and the total dosage were varied. In addition, one test involved the use 
of a time-varying dose rate. Less extensive tests were performed on the       
Orbiter's USO, in which the dose rate, but not the total dosage was varied.   
For most of these tests, the dose rates used (0.5 to 3 rad s^-1) were         
comparable to those expected in the Jovian environment.                       
     We have developed an empirical model of the frequency drift induced by   
radiation by simulating the radiation calibration tests. Figure 5(b)          
illustrates this model and Figure 5(c) shows its ability to reproduce one of  
the tests. In both cases, a constant dose rate was applied for a limited time 
interval. Clearly, the model approximately reproduces the data.               
     In actuality, especially for the Probe, the applied dose rates will vary 
significantly as the Probe approaches the planet (cf. Figure 5(a)). We can    
apply the model of Figure 5(b) to this situation by appropriately averaging,  
NOT summing, the response curves produced by a series of discrete and constant
dose rates that approximate the actual time-varying behavior. Based on this   
approach and the dose rates of Figure 5(a), we estimated the radiation induced
drifts that the Probe's oscillator will undergo during the relay link, as     
shown in Figure 5(d). The kinks in the predicted curves are artifacts of our  
discretizing the dose rate curves for use in our model. Averaged over the     
relay link, the nominal radiation-induced drift would produce a frequency     
change of about 0.4 Hz over a 30-min period. The corresponding curve for the  
'worst case' dose profile yields a drift that is about a factor of 2 higher   
than the nominal case near the start of the link and fairly similar to the    
nominal case near the end of the link.                                        
     A somewhat smaller drift will be experienced by the USO on the Orbiter.  
This USO will experience a more constant radiation dose rate of about 1 rad   
s^-1. Tests on the Orbiter USO suggest that it will experience a radiation    
induced drift of about 0.07 Hz during the relay link.                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.3. PROPAGATION EFFECTS                                                      
                                                                              
     The frequency of the Probe's signal, as measured at the Orbiter, can be  
affected by its passage through the Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere. First,  
the propagation time is altered by the signal's passage through a refracting  
medium. More precisely, the phase path length will be retarded by the neutral 
atmosphere and advanced by the ionosphere. Since the phase path length varies 
with time due to these effects, the measured frequency will be altered from   
the value that would be found in the absence of a refracting medium along the 
path. Second, the direction of the signal is slightly altered by refraction.  
This induces a small, time-varying, change to the Probe aspect angle for the  
ray that reaches the Orbiter, thereby altering the Doppler shift produced by  
the horizontal winds and the planet's rotational velocity. These effects,     
especially that due to the neutral atmosphere, can be quite large. But,       
fortunately, they can be allowed for with high precision in the a posteriori  
analysis, since the indices of refraction along the path length will be known 
quite well.                                                                   
     Based on the formalism developed in Paper I and Atkinson and Spilker     
(1990) and the characteristics of the Probe's descent profile during the relay
link, we find that refraction by the neutral atmosphere can be expected to    
produce a systematic variation of less than a Hz in the measured frequency    
over the relay link (Table I). Furthermore, almost all of this variation can  
be removed a posteriori by using the highly accurate profiles of pressure and 
temperature, obtained by the ASI experiment, in conjunction with compositional
information obtained from several Probe experiments.                          
     In a similar vein, frequency drifts due to passage through the Jovian    
ionosphere can be estimated from the formalism of Paper I and Atkinson and    
Spilker (1990). Using electron density profiles derived from past spacecraft  
occultation experiments, we find that the frequency shifts are quite small,   
even a priori (cf. Table I). Even smaller shifts occur during the passage of  
the signal through the Jovian magnetosphere.                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.4. MISCELLANEOUS EFFECTS                                                    
                                                                              
     The measured frequency is also affected by the gravitational red shift of
general relativity, the time dilation effect of special relativity, and other 
higher-order terms that appear when the exact form of the Doppler shift       
equation is used. Here, we simply provide estimates of the magnitudes of these
effects to assess the importance of including them in the final analyses. All 
of these can be treated quite accurately and so need not generate significant 
errors in the recovered wind.                                                 
     The gravitational red shift produces a large constant frequency shift and
a very small systematic one, both of which can be reduced to negligible       
amounts by appropriately calculating them (Paper I; cf. Table I). Errors      
introduced by neglecting higher-order terms in the equation of special        
relativity (cf. Equation (3)) and by truncating the Taylor series expansion of
the Doppler frequency residuals (cf. Equation (7)) result in systematic       
frequency errors on the order of 10^-2 Hz (Paper I). Thus, they can be safely 
neglected.                                                                    
                                                                              
                                 4. Simulations                               
                                                                              
     In this section, we use the linear least-squares algorithm developed in  
the approach section to recover wind profiles from simulated data. The        
simulated data were generated for each of the four wind profiles of Figure 1. 
In most cases, we included the more prominent errors of Table I to make the   
simulations realistic. These simulations are directed at addressing and       
answering several basic questions about our approach and the feasibility of   
recovering a wind profile from the Galileo Probe's telemetry: Are Legendre    
polynomials a useful set of basis functions for the zonal winds of Jupiter?   
How would we detect and analyze regions of sudden shears? What accuracy in the
recovered wind profile is possible, given plausible error sources? What are   
the limitations on the vertical resolution of the recovered profile?          
     We carried out simulations for the nominal Probe and Orbiter trajectories
for a time interval ranging from 200 to 300 s after Probe 'entry'. Probe entry
occurs when it reaches an altitude of 450 km above the 1 bar pressure level.  
During the time interval of the simulations, the Probe traverses pressure     
levels ranging from 800 mb to 25 bars. In reality, the relay link could begin 
as early as 120 s after entry, when the Probe is at the 100 mb level. The     
conclusions drawn based on the chosen period of simulation are equally valid  
for other possible periods.                                                   
     Figure 2 shows the variation of the Probe aspect angle, psi, and azimuth 
angle, alpha, with time from entry. These angles define the relationship      
between the zonal direction and the line of sight and hence the projection of 
the zonal wind speed on the line of sight. At the start of the simulated relay
link, psi has a value of 6 degrees; it reaches a minimum value of 1.6 degrees 
at 21 min, the time that the Orbiter crosses the Probe's meridian; and it     
increases to a value of nearly 10 degrees by the end of the link. Throughout  
almost all this time, alpha has a value close to 0 degrees, since the Probe   
and Orbiter have nearly coplanar locations, but it goes through 90 degrees at 
the time that the Orbiter crosses the Probe's meridian.                       
     The first step in performing a simulation is to construct two frequency  
profiles. We refer to the first profile of frequency as a function of time as 
a 'true' profile, in the sense that it corresponds to what would really be    
measured and conveyed from the Orbiter to the Earth for analysis. It is       
generated by including the influence of the candidate wind profile on the     
measured frequency, by using the 'real' trajectories, and by including a      
variety of effects that would change the USOs' frequencies from their         
ground-based measured values, including oscillator aging, probe spin,         
atmospheric turbulence, measurement errors at the Orbiter, and the            
Gravitational red shift. The second profile, the 'nominal' profile, is        
obtained by neglecting winds (they are not known a priori), using the         
ground-based frequency of the oscillators, and trajectory information that    
differs from the 'real' trajectories by 1 sigma errors based on Table I. Table
IV summarizes the errors introduced into the two profiles that were used in   
the simulations discussed below.

     Once the two frequency profiles have been generated, we subtracted the   
nominal profile from the true one to generate frequency residuals. Next, we   
subtracted from the residuals at all times t the residuals at the reference   
time, t_r, which we take as the initial time of the link. These operations    
produce the Doppler data, Delta f_Dop. We apply the least-squares algorithm to
this Doppler data to recover the zonal wind speed profile and compare the     
recovered profile with the 'true' profile to assess the accuracy of the       
recovery. This assessment is done by plotting the two wind profiles as well as
evaluating their root mean square (r.m.s.) difference and their mean          
difference. The latter provides a measure of the systematic offset between the
two profiles. In order to keep the computational time at a reasonable level,  
we generated data every 10 s during the relay link (280 samples altogether).  
     It might seem that the time of overflight offers a better choice for the 
reference time, t_r, since the zonal winds do not affect the measured         
frequency at overflight. Indeed. such a choice might neatly yield the Probe   
USO's zero-point frequency, if the meridional and vertical wind speeds are    
sufficiently small. Unfortunately, the 0.23 degree uncertainty in the Probe's 
descent longitude, when combined with the planet's rotational speed of 10 km  
s^-1, leads to a 26 m s^-1 error in the Probe-Orbiter range rate. This offset 
is essentially constant throughout the relay link so that it does not provide 
a marker of the actual time of overflight. Thus, the uncertainty in the       
Probe's position prevents a useful determination of the USO's zero-point      
frequency from being made. But, the near constancy of the resulting error     
permits its impact to be substantially reduced by using frequency differences 
as the primary data to be analyzed.                                           
     We first assess the adequacy of a sum of Legendre polynomials to         
represent the wind profiles by determining the r.m.s. error in the recovered  
wind profile as a function of the order of the polynomial expansion for the   
four profiles of Figure 1. For all four wind profiles of Figure 1, an         
asymptotic error of a few m s^-1 is closely approached by expansions of order 
5 and larger (Paper I). Below, we perform further simulations using an        
expansion of order 5. We conclude that the Legendre polynomial expansion      
provides a good representation of the wind profiles of Figure 1, since only a 
small number of terms are needed and since the r.m.s. error is comparable to  
that expected from the error sources of Table IV.                             
     We next assess the influence of random errors in the measured frequency  
on the accuracy of the recovered wind profile. For this purpose, we used      
covariance analysis. The mathematical procedure used to relate variances in   
the measured frequency to variances in the recovered wind speed is given in   
Paper I. Using the random errors given in Table I for the Allen variances of  
the Probe and Orbiter USOs and for the digitization error, we find that the   
total random error in the measured frequency is approximately 0.053 Hz. The   
corresponding random errors in the recovered winds at several times during the
relay link are given in Table V for the latent heat wind profile of Figure 1. 
Similar results pertain to the other wind profiles.                           
     The variances in the wind speed shown in Table V are less than 1 m s^-1. 
Thus, our least-squares formalism is stable for reasonable choices of random  
errors and the implied variances in wind speed will not significantly degrade 
its recovery. The application of this formalism to our standard model in which
the entry longitude of the Probe was added as an unknown showed that it was   
not possible to also derive this key parameter from the Doppler data: very    
large variances in wind speed were obtained in this case.                     
     We next present the results of full-up simulations that incorporate the  
ensemble of constant, random, and systematic errors given in Table IV. Figures

show comparisons of the recovered wind profiles with the 'true' profiles for  
the four standard wind models. Table VI summarizes the r.m.s. and mean wind   
errors for these 4 simulations. Finally, Figure 6(b) shows the corresponding  
least-squares residuals as a function of pressure in the atmosphere for the   
first of these recoveries. Similar residuals pertain to the other cases. The  
frequency residuals are the instantaneous differences between the frequencies 
derived from the recovered winds and the 'true' values. (In both cases, the   
frequency at the start of the relay link has been subtracted out.) As         
anticipated earlier in the paper, it is possible to recover not only the shape
of the wind profiles, but also their absolute values. The residual profiles do
not show any large biases over limited regions of pressure, indicating that   
the least-squares algorithm is working well.                                  
     To evaluate the relative importance of the various error sources of Table
IV in affecting the accuracy of the wind recovery and the possible impacts of 
sources not considered in this table, we have carried out a series of         
sensitivity studies. For this purpose, we used the latent heat wind profile as
a base profile. As a standard of comparison, we first performed a wind        
recovery with all the errors set equal to 0. As shown in Table VI, the        
recovered winds are not in exact agreement with the true ones. This difference
is attributable to a combination of the truncation of the polynomial expansion
at order 5 and the finite number of data points used in our analysis.         
     We next conducted several numerical experiments in which alternately only
errors due to frequency effects, Probe descent velocity, and Probe entry      
longitude were considered. These three types of errors are the most           
significant ones, according to Table I. As shown in Table VI, the error in    
entry longitude has the biggest impact on the accuracy of the wind recovery.  
     The large impact of an error in Probe longitude on the accuracy of the   
recovered winds prompted us to evaluate the errors in these winds that        
resulted when the errors in Probe entry longitude and latitude were           
systematically varied. According to the results shown in Table VI, both the   
r.m.s. error and the mean error increase significantly, but not               
catastrophically, as the errors in these two coordinates are separately

vary comparatively slowly with pressure. Conceivably, there could be localized
regions of the Jovian atmosphere where much steeper shears exist. To simulate 
this possibility we added a shear to the latent heat wind profile. The shear  
region was placed in the 2.3 to 4.4 bar location. which the Probe traverses in
about 250 s. Thus, about 25 data points out of a total of 280 were affected by
the shear. Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show the retrieval and residuals obtained  
for a case in which a shear of tens of m s^-1

was imposed on the nominal wind profile (wind model of Figure 10(a)). The     
corresponding r.m.s. and mean errors are given in Table VI. Even in this      
extreme case a reasonably accurate recovery is possible, except of course in  
the shear zone itself. Furthermore, the residuals show an anomalous behavior  
in the region of the shear. In such a case, we will use a different type of   
analysis than the one used for the large-scale winds, one similar to the      
classical Doppler method. We are currently developing the protocol to recover 
both the shear and the large-scale wind profile in an iterative fashion.

     Finally, we considered the impact on the recovery of a time-independent  
meridional wind. A constant 10 m s^-1 north-south wind had a negligible impact
on the errors of the recovered wind, while even a 100 m s^-1 north-south wind 
did not increase the r.m.s.

and mean errors by very much (Table VI). This insensitivity is due primarily  
to the small values of alpha during much of the descent sequence, which       
minimizes the projection of the meridional wind on the line of sight. In      
addition, the recovery is not too sensitive to the latitudinal location of the
Probe.                                                                        
     The vertical resolution of the retrieved wind profile is fundamentally   
limited by the finite response time of the Probe to changes in the zonal wind 
speed. According to the derivations given in Seiff et al. (1980) and Paper I, 
the Probe's zonal wind speed adjusts to a change in the atmospheric value on a
time-scale tau_h = w_p/g, where w_p is the vertical descent speed of the Probe
and g is the acceleration of gravity. During this characteristic time scale,  
the Probe moves vertically a distance, l_min = w_p tau_h.                     
     Table VII gives estimates of the Probe's descent velocity, response time 
tau_h and minimum vertical distance, l_min, for a range of positions in the   
Jovian atmosphere. As indicated above, the relay link will begin when the     
Probe is at the several hundred mb level and end when the probe is at about   
the 25 bar level.

Probe adjusts to changes in the zonal wind speed on time scales ranging from  
almost 10 s at the start of the link to slightly more than 1 s at its end. The
corresponding minimum distances range from on the order of 1 km to several    
tens of meters. Thus, the Probe responds quickly enough to changes in the     
zonal wind speed so that good vertical resolution is possible during the      
entire relay link.  Near the end of the relay link the response time          
approaches the sampling time of 2/3 s that separates successive measurements  
of the Probe's frequency made by the Orbiter's relay radio system.

     We have developed a practical approach for estimating the zonal wind     
speed profile within Jupiter's upper troposphere from its influence on the    
frequency of the Galileo Probe's telemetry signal. This was achieved by       
linearizing the relativistic Doppler shift equation about a state of zero wind
speed, expanding the zonal wind speed in a Legendre polynomial series, and    
reducing the resulting equations to a linear least-squares problem. Since the 
instantaneous Doppler shift depends on both the instantaneous zonal wind speed
and a time integral of this speed, it is possible to recover not only the     
vertical wind shear, but also the absolute wind velocity without an accurate  
knowledge of the USOs' zero-point frequencies.                                
     There are a very large number of factors that can introduce errors into  
the wind profile retrieved from the Probe's Doppler-shifted frequency.        
Fortunately, the collective impact of these error sources appears to be       
sufficiently mild so that the uncertainty in the retrieved winds should be    
only a few m s^-1. The largest error source is the uncertainty in the Probe's 
entry location. Consequently, it is essential that the Orbiter's trajectory be
carefully monitored before, during, and after Probe release to provide as     
accurate a determination of the Probe's trajectory subsequent to release and  
hence as accurate an estimate of its entry location as possible. Other        
potentially major error sources include uncertainties in the descent velocity 
and frequency errors, especially those produced by systematic drifts (e.g.,   
radiation-induced drifts and aging). Finally, random variations in frequency  
can produce r.m.s. errors in the wind speeds of several tenths of a m s^-1 as 
determined by co-variance analysis.                                           
     If the error sources have magnitudes comparable to or smaller than the   
ones given here, the retrieved wind speed profiles can be used for a number of
important purposes. These include placing a key constraint on the basic drive 
for the atmospheric circulation as well as anchoring winds derived from       
orbiter images to well-defined vertical positions in the atmosphere. With     
regard to the first of these objectives, it might seem a little naive to      
expect to learn something fundamental about the atmospheric circulation from a
single vertical profile. Certainly, the retrieved profile will be influenced  
by eddy motions on a variety of scales and thus will not be an accurate       
representation of the time and longitudinal average profile at the entry      
latitude. However, experience with Venus indicates that the time and          
zonally-averaged zonal winds are the dominant component of zonal winds        
measured at a single entry site (Councelman et al., 1980). Finally, as        
mentioned earlier, data taken by a variety of Galileo experiments should help 
to flesh out the various wind models of Figure 1, leading to more precise     
predictions that can be compared to and, hopefully, distinguished among by the
wind profile retrieved by the Galileo Doppler wind experiment.
