     Abstract. The Galileo Net Flux Radiometer (NFR) is a Probe instrument    
designed to measure the vertical profile of upward and net radiation fluxes   
in five spectral bands spanning the range from solar to far infrared          
wavelengths. These unique measurements within Jupiter's atmosphere, from which
radiative heating and profiles will be derived, will contribute to our        
understanding of Jovian atmospheric dynamics, to the detection of cloud layers
and determination of their opacities, and to the estimation of water vapor    
abundance. The NFR uses an array of pyroelectric detectors and individual     
bandpass filters in a sealed detector package. The detector package and optics
rotate as a unit to provide chopping between views of upward and downward     
radiation fluxes. This arrangement makes possible the measurement of small net
fluxes in the presence of large ambient fluxes. A microprocessor-controlled   
electronics package handles instrument operation.                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
                               1. Introduction                                
                                                                              
     The Galileo Probe Net Flux Radiometer (NFR) is designed to measure the   
net radiation flux and upward radiation flux within Jupiter's atmosphere as   
the Probe descends by parachute. The nominal measurement regime for the NFR   
extends from about 0.1 bar to at least 10 bars, which corresponds to an       
altitude range from 48 km above the 1-bar level to 91 km below it. These      
measurements will help to define sources and sinks of planetary radiation.    
regions of solar energy deposition, and provide constraints on atmospheric    
composition (primarily water vapor). The instrument was designed and built by 
Martin Marietta, later modified to incorporate design improvements developed  
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where the instrument was calibrated.   
The NFR Principal Investigator is L.A. Sromovsky of the University of         
Wisconsin-Madison, and the Co-Investigators are J. Pollack of Ames Research   
Center, M. Tomasko of the University of Arizona, J. Hayden of Martin Marietta 
Astronautics Group, and H. Revercomb, also from the University of Wisconsin.  
     Following a brief description of the scientific objectives of the        
experiment, we describe the instrument hardware, how it functions, and how it 
is calibrated. Finally, we present a brief summary of expected errors and     
performance characteristics.                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
                            2. Scientific Objectives                          
                                                                              
2.1. MEASURING DRIVING FORCES FOR ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION                     
                                                                              
     Absorbed solar radiation and the flux of energy from the planet's        
interior provide the primary drive for atmospheric motions in Jupiter's       
atmosphere. Because solar radiation absorption and planetary emission occur at
different places and altitudes, net atmospheric heating and cooling result in 
buoyancy differences which force atmospheric motions. An understanding of     
Jovian circulation thus requires knowledge of the vertical profile of         
radiative heating and cooling and its horizontal distribution as well.        
     The NFR measurements contribute to this understanding by measuring the   
net radiation flux as a function of altitude. This net flux, the difference   
between upward and downward radiation powers crossing a horizontal surface per
unit area, is directly related to the radiative heating or cooling of the     
local atmosphere: the radiative power per unit area absorbed by an atmospheric
layer is equal to the difference in net fluxes at the boundaries of the layer.
At any point in the atmosphere radiative power absorbed per unit volume is    
thus given by the vertical derivative of net flux (dF/dz), and the            
corresponding heating rate is just dT/dt = (dF/dz)/(rhoC_p), where rho is the 
local atmospheric density and C_p is the local atmospheric specific heat at   
constant pressure.                                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.2. OBJECTIVES OF SPECTRAL FLUX MEASUREMENTS                                 
                                                                              
     Because the Galileo Probe will provide only one sample profile of Jovian 
atmospheric conditions at one location, it is especially important to         
understand why the measured radiative energy deposition occurs: we might then 
have some idea of how to apply the results to other atmospheric regions which 
were not sampled. The NFR experiment contributes to understanding horizontal  
variations by making spectral measurements which illuminate the mechanisms by 
which radiation interacts with the atmosphere. When these are interpreted with
other Probe measurements and linked with Orbiter observations they provide a  
basis for using orbiter observations to extend radiative heating              
determinations to other locations on the planet (Hunten et al., 1986).        
     Using six detector channels, the NFR measures net and upward flux        
densities in five spectral bands. The specific objectives of each channel are 
briefly described in the following paragraphs and also summarized in Table I.

     Channel A: Spectral range from 3 to 500 micro m (the broadband thermal   
channel). Net flux measurements define sources and sinks of planetary         
radiation. When used with calculations of gas opacity effects, these          
observations define the thermal opacity of particulates, which is much harder 
to calculate.                                                                 
     Channel B: Spectral range from 0.3 to 3.5 micro m (the broadband solar   
channel). Net flux measurements determine the solar energy deposition profile;
upflux measurements help discriminate between cloud particle absorption and   
extinction.                                                                   
     Channel C: Spectral range from 3.5 to 5.8 micro m (the excess thermal    
channel). Net flux and upward flux measurements define the excess thermal     
energy emitted by Jupiter within this atmospheric window; this channel is very
sensitive to both cloud opacity and the water vapor mixing ratio and will be  
used also to constrain other measurements of water.                           
     Channel D: Spectral range from 14 to 35 micro m (the water vapor         
channel). Net flux measurements define regions of combined hydrogen and water 
vapor absorption; water vapor will be deduced from deviations from known      
hydrogen effects. Where atmospheric opacity is high, net flux in this channel 
will be proportional to the product of local opacity (unknown) and the local  
temperature gradient (independently measured).                                
     Channel E: Spectral range from 0.6 to 3.5 micro m (the methane channel). 
Net flux and upward flux measurements in this band are strongly affected by   
cloud particles as are the broader band channel B measurements, but channel E 
is proportionately more strongly affected by methane band absorption;         
comparison with the broader band measurements of channel B will allow a       
'methane-free' determination of cloud particle absorption effects.            
     Channel F: A spectrally blind channel (the witness channel). Measurements
by this detector provide information needed to correct for extraneous detector
perturbations.                                                                
     It should be noted that none of the NFR measurements is really a direct  
measurement which is unencumbered by the need to assume some characteristics  
of the parameters to be measured. Rather than measuring net flux directly, the
NFR samples the angular domain and weights non-uniformly the spectral         
variations in the radiation field. To interpret these measurements requires   
modelling of the radiation field as a function of composition, cloud, and     
thermal structure. The measurements then provide strong constraints on the    
models rather than provide direct determinations of model parameters.

3.1. PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION                                                   
                                                                              
     The NFR consists of two major sub-assemblies: the electronics module     
(EM), and optical head (OH), shown mated together in Figure 1. The electronics
module is about 13 cm x 19.5 cm x 16 cm high while the optical head is about  
8.5 cm x 8 cm high x 10.5 cm long. The total weight of the NFR is 3.134 kg, of
which 0.672 kg is due to the optical head. The electronics module has four    
feet which are bolted to the Probe instrument shelf. The optical head,        
supported only by its attachment to the electronics module, extends out of the
Probe through the Probe thermal blanket and aeroshell to allow the NFR sensors
to view atmospheric radiation.                                                
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 1. Physical configuration of the NFR instrument. The total length of the 
optical head is approximately 10.5 cm. The part of the optical head beyond the
flange is directly exposed to the ambient Jovian environment.                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Optical Head                                                                  
                                                                              
     The NFR optical head, shown in cutaway view in Figure 2, contains optics,
detectors, and preamplifiers which rotate as a unit as they chop between      
upward and downward atmospheric views, or between ambient and internal heated 
black-bodies for on-board calibration measurements. Flexible circuits carry   
power to the preamplifiers and analog signals from the pre-amplifiers to the  
electronics module for further processing. The rotating optics assembly is    
supported by a front and rear bearing and driven through a gear by a stepper  
motor. The front housing, which supports the front bearing, has two apertures 
through which atmospheric radiation can reach the diamond window. A curved    
band, or shroud, is attached to the rotating optics to restrict the flow of   
gas through the front housing apertures no matter what position the window is 
in.                                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
Optics and Field of View                                                      
                                                                              
     The optical system, shown in Figure 3, consist of a diamond window, a    
folding mirror, a toroidal mirror, a condensing cone, and spectral filters    
which are part of the detector package. An unfolded diagram of the optics is  
shown in Figure 3(b).  The toroidal mirror images the diamond window at the   
entrance of the condensing cone.

Fig. 2. NFR Optical Head. During net flux measurements the detector package   
and optics rotate between upward and downward viewing positions, which are    
respectively 45 degrees below and above horizontal. Though it is not shown in 
this diagram, the front housing also has a bottom aperture to allow viewing   
upward flux (see Figure 1).                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
three mirror images are imaged approximately 0.76" behind the diamond window. 
This arrangement allows the detector to be positioned in a thermally isolated 
location while still achieving a relatively large field of view of nominally  
0.4 sr (+-20 degrees about the nominal viewing directions of 45 degrees above 
and below horizontal).                                                        
     Because of viewing and thermal constraints on the instrument, the NFR    
samples only part of upward and downward radiation fields, rather than        
integrating over the entire hemispheres. Thus, the NFR actually measures a    
weighted net spectral radiance rather than a net flux. The viewing directions 
of +-45 degrees from horizontal, instead of +-90 degrees, actually provide a  
more representative sample because the largest contribution to the net flux   
occurs at +-45 degrees (when solid-angle weighting is included).              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Detector Package                                                              
                                                                              
     All NFR spectral channels use pyroelectric thermal detectors to convert  
absorbed radiation power to electrical signals (the operation of these        
detectors is described in a following section on analog signal                
characteristics). The NFR detector package contains an array of six lithium   
tantalate detectors mounted in close proximity on a single circuit board      
(Figure 4). This circuit board is bonded to a hermetically sealed hybrid      
preamplifier package to which the detectors are electrically connected (Figure
5). Spectral                                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 3. Rotating optics layout (a) and unfolded ray-trace diagram (b). The    
condenser cone reflects three angular images of the detectors which the       
toroidal mirror brings to a focus 0.76" behind the diamond window together    
with the prime image. The diameter of the base of the condenser cone is just  
large enough to prevent obscuration of the six-detector array. The diamond    
window is focussed at the entrance to the condenser cone.                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
filters are mounted in a filter frame which is pin-located and screw-mounted  
to the detector circuit board. The location pins (see Figure 4) are also used 
in detector fabrication to insure proper positioning of the detector elements 
relative to the filter frame openings.                                        
     The detectors were fabricated by Infrared Associates of Cranbury, New    
Jersey. Each pyroelectric detector element consists of a LiTaO3 crystal       
approximately 1 mm x 2 mm x 25 micro m (about 0.001" thick). Lithium tantalate
was chosen as the pyroelectric material because it has a Curie point well     
above the expected operating temperature and thus would not become            
depolarized. The NFR detector elements have unusually smooth edges because    
they are cut from a larger piece of crystal using ion-beam milling instead of 
a diamond saw. These smooth edges result in crystals which are exceptionally  
rugged. The bottom electrode of each element is opaque gold and is applied    
before the detector material is cut into individual elements. The top         
electrode                                                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 4. Detector module photograph. The six pyroelectric elements in the      
center of the photograph have been overexposed to make them more visible (the 
paint coating the detectors is much blacker than it appears in this photo).   
Detector leads are soldered to eyelets which are connected to runs on the back
side of the detector circuit board. The alignment pins are used during        
fabrication as well as for positioning the filter frame. Each detector element
is approximately 1 mm x 2 mm.                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
is vacuum-deposited after the elements are mounted in the array and consists  
of a transparent layer of nichrome with small gold pads deposited for lead    
bonding. Platinum leads of 12.5 micron diameter are attached to top and bottom
electrodes using electrically conductive epoxy. (The other ends of the leads  
are soldered to the circuit board.) The top electrode is sized to match the   
desired active area and is somewhat smaller than the crystal itself. Black    
paint (3M velvet) is applied to the top surface so as to cover the active area
but not the entire detector. The typical paint thickness is 20-25 microns     
(slightly less than 0.001"). Because LiTaO3 is a piezoelectric material, as   
well as a pyroelectric, the detector elements are mounted on 0.015"-high mesas
made of a vibration dampening material called Visilox.                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 5. NFR Detector/Hybrid Assembly. This drawing shows a 1" x 1" detector   
module bonded to the preamplifier can, which is in turn bonded to a beryllium 
stiffener. Upper and lower filter frames are shown mounted above the detector 
array. Note that a stack of two filter elements is used for channel C. The    
0.033 cm^3 volume enclosed between the filter frame and the detectors (shown  
in the side view) is sealed and back-filled with xenon.                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
     Detectors have a primary thermal time constant of approximately 110 ms,  
an electrical capacitance of about 40 pF, and a responsivity of approximately 
1400 V/W. Noise associated with the detectors is generally dominated by       
Johnson noise of the detector load resistor.                                  
     The spectral filter materials and thicknesses are listed in Table II.    
(All channels experience additional spectral filtering by the 0.2 mm thick    
diamond window at the entrance to the rotating optics, the spectral           
reflectivity of the mirrors, and the spectral response of the detectors.) As  
indicated in Figure 5, there are two filter frames: an upper frame containing 
only a CaF2 long-wave blocker for channel C, and a lower filter frame         
containing five spectral filters and one opaque blocker for the blind         
channel. All filters are epoxy bonded in place on shelves machined into the   
filter frame.                                                                 
     The detector package is hermetically sealed and backfilled with xenon gas
at ambient pressure (about 800 mb). The seal alone eliminates an extreme      
sensitivity to external

pressure modulations. The backfill of the very heavy xenon gas is used to     
buffer the small amount of hydrogen gas which will diffuse into the detector  
package during descent. The buffering effect maintains a low thermal          
conductivity inside the detector package and thereby eliminates significant   
thermal crosstalk which otherwise would occur via gas conduction between      
detector elements. Other benefits of the seal include making the detector     
responsivity independent of external pressure and protecting detector interior
coatings and lead bonds from ambient atmospheric conditions. The seal is      
accomplished first by sealing the filters into the lower filter frame (then   
leak testing and patching if required). The second step is to epoxy both the  
lower and upper filter frame on the detector board with a hypodermic needle   
temporarily replacing one of the alignment pins. The needle provides access to
the sealed volume so that leak testing and patching can be carried out until  
all leaks are sealed. The detector package (with hypodermic) is then          
backfilled with xenon and placed in a glove box filled with xenon. Within the 
glove box the hypodermic needle is removed and an alignment pin is epoxied in 
its place to complete the seal. After the epoxy is cured the entire package is
leak tested using a radiometric technique to verify absence of a gross leak   
and then with a mass spectrometer scanning over the xenon peak to measure the 
fine leak. A leak rate of approximately 7 x 10^-10 cc s^-1 or less (of Xe at  
STP) was measured for the flight detector package, implying that about 100 mb 
of Xe will be present inside the detector package at entry, ensuring that the 
seal objectives will be met (see later discussion of expected performance).   
                                                                              
                                                                              
Internal Sources                                                              
                                                                              
     When the optical system is not viewing external radiation, it views one  
of two internal radiation sources: an ambient black-body source which is      
thermally coupled to the wall of the front housing, and a heated black-body   
source which is servo-controlled to a temperature of approximately 107 degrees
C (the servo point is attained in air or vacuum, but generally is not attained
in He or H2 atmospheres where high gas conductivity limits the black-body     
temperature to a maximum differential above the ambient atmospheric           
temperature). By chopping the view between these two internal sources it is   
possible to carry out approximate internal calibrations during laboratory     
testing and as part of in-flight checkouts during the cruise phase of the     
mission. However, during the descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the hot      
black-body will operate much closer to the temperature of the ambient         
black-body and the accuracy of internal calibrations will not be very high.

     A 90 degree step^-1, bipolar, 2-phase stepper motor and a 2 to 1 gear set
are used to rotate the optics and detector system. Each step of the motor     
results in 45 degrees of motion for the optics. Following the convention      
defined in Figure 6, the upward viewing position of the

optics is defined to be at 0 degrees, the ambient black-body position at 90   
degrees, the downward view at 180 degrees, and the hot black-body at          
270 degrees. The motor has torque sufficient to move the rotor 180 degrees in 
about 60 ms.                                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
Window Heater                                                                 
                                                                              
     A 300 mW heater is used to maintain the external diamond window slightly 
warmer than the ambient atmosphere, thereby preventing condensation on the    
window.                                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Optical Head Ventilation Design                                               
                                                                              
     Because the rotating optics could not structurally support a             
high-pressure differential, the interior of the rotating optics is not sealed,
and will admit ambient external gas during descent. Thermal modelling of the  
NFR shows that the detector package temperature will lag behind the external  
atmospheric temperature during all but the early part of descent. To inhibit  
possible condensation on interior optical surfaces, gas flow into the rotor is
controlled by vents within the electronics module and at the base of the      
rotor. These vents take advantage of the dynamic pressure distribution around 
the Galileo descent Probe which provides a positive pressure differential     
between the inside of the Probe and the external atmosphere in the vicinity of
the NFR apertures. The predicted gas flow is first into the Probe through a   
large vent at the back of the Probe. Some of this gas enters the electronics  
module through a Line 5A molecular sieve filter provided at the top of the    
electronics (see Figure 1). The filtered gas, also warmed by the electronics  
module, enters the rear of the optical head through a vent provided at the    
base of the electronics module. From this point the gas flows partly into the 
rotor through the rotor base vent (near the rear bearing) and partly through  
the motor and rotor bearings into the forward part of the optical head and    
then through the apertures into the external atmosphere. The differential     
pressure driving this flow is approximately 1 mb and at 1 atm the total flow  
rate through the optical head will be approximately 100 cc s^-1.              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Method of Operation                                                           
                                                                              
     The various modes of NFR operation are illustrated in Figure 6. To       
perform the net flux measurement the motor first positions the optics at 0    
degrees, then alternately cycles 4 steps down (45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees)  
and 4 steps up (135, 90, 45, and 0 degrees). The optics is cycled down and up 
twice each second. During approximately 60 ms of each half cycle the optics is
in transition, leaving approximately 190 ms for staring up or down. Eleven    
up-down cycles of the optics are integrated to make one net flux instrument   
cycle (IC) which is transmitted to the Probe data system at a rate of one IC  
every 6 s. Up flux and blackbody calibrate instrument cycles are performed in 
a similar fashion. To make an up flux measurement the rotor is first          
positioned at 90 degrees to view the ambient blackbody then alternately cycled
between down (180 degrees) and the ambient blackbody (90 degrees). For        
blackbody calibration, the optics is first positioned to view the ambient     
blackbody (90 degrees) then cycled between the hot black-body (170 degrees)   
and the ambient blackbody.                                                    
     During the last powered pulse of each half of a chopping cycle the       
unpowered of the two motor coils is electrically shorted to activate          
eddy-current damping which provides greater stability of motion and more      
accurate pointing (especially in the Up Flux mode). A set of position sensors 
is used to verify correct rotor positioning within 5 degrees of the nominal   
position. The LEDs used to stimulate the position sensors may degrade         
substantially during radiation exposure and therefore cannot be relied on to  
verify pointing during descent. However, LED degradation will not affect motor
operation since the motor is driven with an open loop system which does not   
require position feedback.                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
Mode Sequences                                                                
                                                                              
     The NFR operating modes are carried out in a sequence which repeats at   
2-min intervals. Each complete sequence, called a data cycle (DC), consists of
20 six-second ICs. As defined in Table III, each DC uses one IC for the       
Blackbody Calibrate (BC) sample, one for the Up Flux (UF) sample, and one for 
Analog Zero (AZ), to be explained later. This leaves 17 ICs available for Net 
Flux (NF) measurements. Because of offset level shifts between different input
sources, the net flux measurements following AZ and UF modes are              
'short-cycled', meaning that only the last five of the eleven up-down flip    
cycles are included in the measurement. All AZ measurements, except the first,
are also short-cycled because they immediately follow the large offset        
developed during the BC mode. Housekeeping data, listed at the right side of  
Table III, provides information on temperatures, voltages, and currents (the  
acronyms used here are defined in the table caption).

A functional block diagram of the NFR electronics is shown in Figure 7. The   
design is centered around a CMOS microprocessor control system very similar to
that used

on the Atmospheric Structure Instrument (ASI) for the Galileo Probe (Seiff et 
al., 1990). Functional elements of the NFR electronics are described in the   
following paragraphs.                                                         
                                                                              
Digital Circuits                                                              
                                                                              
     The microprocessor system consists of the 1802 CPU (Central Processing   
Unit), 256 words of RAM (Random Access Memory), 6144 8-bit words of PROM      
(Programmable Read-Only Memory), nine I/O (Input/Output) ports and a power-up 
reset circuit. The RAM is used to provide 256 bytes of temporary storage for  
data values during data accumulation and manipulation. The six 1-Kbyte PROMs  
contain the program necessary to operate the instrument. At any given time    
only the one of the six PROMS is turned on and for only micro second of the 8 
micro second machine cycle, providing a factor of 48 reduction of power       
consumption by the PROMS. Six 8-bit wide output ports are used to control the 
non-digital NFR subsystems. Three input ports are used to read data from the  
NFR subsystems.                                                               
   The 2048 Hz spacecraft clock is divided down to a 4-Hz signal which is used
to interrupt the microprocessor. The MINOR FRAME signal from the spacecraft is
used to synchronize the 4-Hz timer and also to synchronize the software with  
spacecraft timing. The software does not begin cycling in its normal mode     
until the microprocessor detects a MINOR FRAME interrupt.                     
     The PROM software controls the sequence, timing, and duration of motor   
control pulses. After each cycle of the optical rotor, position sensor photo  
transistors are read to determine if the optics are at the correct position.  
If any one of the 22 half cycles of one instrument cycle (IC) results in an   
incorrect optics position, the microprocessor notes this in the data stream by
setting the motor position error bit to one for that IC.                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
Analog Circuits                                                               
                                                                              
     There are six channels of analog processors, one for each detector. Each 
channel includes a detector signal pre-amplifier, a post-amplifier, a         
demodulator and an integrator. This six pre-amplifiers are housed in a hybrid 
package placed adjacent to the detectors on the rotating optics (see Figure   
5). The rest of the analog circuits reside on two circuit boards within the   
electronics module.                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
Pre-Amplifiers                                                                
                                                                              
     Each pre-amplifier is a DC differential amplifier with a gain of 6.67,   
using U423 dual JFET inputs. The effective input load resistance of 0.909 x   
10^10 Ohms (10^10 Ohms in parallel with 10^11 Ohms) in combination with the   
typical detector capacitance of 40 pF leads to a detector electrical droop    
time constant of 0.36 s. With this droop a typical detector will generate an  
electrical offset of 0.055 V per degree C min^-1 of thermal ramp. During      
descent we expect a thermal ramp less than 7 degree C min^-1 so that the input
offset will not exceed 0.38 V, comfortably less than the pre-amplifier        
saturation level of about 0.75 V. Because the load resistance so much less    
than the 10^13 Ohms detector resistance, detector noise is dominated by the   
Johnson noise of the load resistors (modified by the detector shunt           
capacitance, of course).                                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
Post-Amplifiers                                                               
                                                                              
     The six parallel post-amplifiers each consists of three non-inverting    
amplifiers in series (except for channels B and E which have one inversion to 
correct for an inversion built into the detector package). Single pole RC     
filters are used to block the DC component from the hybrid and to tailor the  
frequency response of the circuit. The filter components are chosen to give a 
maximum response at 16 Hz. This may seem strange in view of our fundamental 2 
Hz detector signal. However, this filter function acts somewhat like a        
differentiator, which, in combination with the following integrator, results  
in a very small sensitivity to the details of signal transitions and a high   
sensitivity only to the final values attained after each flip of the rotor.   
This effect minimizes asymmetry errors (described in a subsequent section).   
     FET (Field Effect Transistor) switches at the input of each host         
amplifier allow the inputs to be grounded through a 100 Ohm resistor,         
providing a zero reading to be integrated as the Analog Zero (AZ) data. The AZ
value is intended to be a measure of offset in the integration circuitry, but 
is also slightly affected by other factors which are still under              
investigation.                                                                
     The gain of the post amplifiers is tailored to the dynamic range expected
from each channel. To extend the dynamic range of channels A, C, and D, which 
receive much stronger signals from the internal heated black-body than they do
from Jupiter's atmosphere, the third amplifiers of the circuits for those     
channels (and also for channel F) have two possible gains selectable with a   
FET switch. The gain is switched to 8 for analog zero (AZ), up flux (UF), and 
net flux (NF) measurements, and switched to unity for the black-body calibrate
(BC) measurement. The solar channels, B and E, receive relatively weak signals
from the on-board calibration source and thus do not need gain reduction      
capabilities.                                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
Demodulator and Integrator                                                    
                                                                              
     Each demodulator is a gain unity, reversible polarity amplifier, the     
polarity of which is controlled by two FET switches, synchronized to the 2-Hz 
NFR decommutation signal.                                                     
     The integrator consists of an inverting amplifier with a 0.82 micro F    
capacitor in the feedback loop and a 1 M Ohm resistor connected between the   
output of the demodulator and the input to the integrating amplifier. A FET   
switch is placed in parallel with the capacitor to short out the charge after 
a measurement has been taken. Two other switches control input to the         
integrator. In one configuration the output of the demodulator is connected to
the integrator (enabling integration); in the other configuration the         
demodulator output is disconnected and the integrator input is sounded        
(holding the integrated value for readout by the A/D converter).              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Gain Select Amplifier (GSA)                                                   
                                                                              
      All six integrator outputs and all housekeeping monitor outputs are     
routed by a 22-channel multiplexer (identified as INPUT MUX in Figure 7) to   
the gain selection circuits which properly scale those analog signals for     
input to the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) described below). A 3-channel  
gain select multiplexer selects either the output of the 22-channel           
multiplexer or the output of one of two cascaded amplifiers, each with a gain 
of eight. The three multiplexed channels view the output of the 22-channel    
multiplexer at gains of 1, 8, and 64.                                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)                                             
                                                                              
     The ADC is a 12-bit, +10 to -10 V, successive approximation type         
converter, used over a +5 to -5 V 11-bit range only. The most significant bit 
(bit 11) indicates polarity of the signal, and the second most significant bit
indicates a positive or negative overrange. Data reported to the Probe        
telemetry include the sign, two bits indicating the gain setting of the GSA,  
and nine bits of data from the ADC (bits 1 through 9 - bit zero is unused).   
     The microprocessor changes the gain of the GSA as required to obtain an  
on-scale reading for the ADC. The GSA is first set to its maximum gain of 64. 
If the processor detects that the ADC is in an overrange condition (input     
greater than +5 or less than -5 V), it sets the GSA to a gain of 8. If this   
also leads to an overrange condition, the GSA is set to a gain of one.        
                                                                              
                                                                              
Housekeeping Monitors                                                         
                                                                              
     The housekeeping data that the NFR in the Probe telemetry stream is      
listed in Table III. The forward voltage drop change with temperature of a    
1N4148 diode serves as the temperature sensor for the detector and electronics
monitors (referenced in the table as DET and ET, respectively). The detector  
temperature sensing diode is mounted directly to the detector board on the    
rotating optics (see Figure 5). The hot black-body (HB) sensor is located on  
the back of a beryllium substrate on which the hot black-body heater resistor 
is painted. The ambient black-body low range (A1) and high range (A2)         
thermistors are located in the ambient black-body which is screw mounted and  
thermally coupled to the front housing wall. The window temperature (WT)      
sensor is located in the window housing structure on the rotating optics. The 
HB, A1, A2, and WT temperature sensors are Fenwal GB38SM43 thermistors.       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Motor Driver                                                                  
                                                                              
     The motor driver is basically a pair of 28-V H-bridge circuits capable of
driving up to 250 mA of reversible current through each of the two motor      
coils. The microprocessor controls the motor driver by writing a one into the 
appropriate latch bit to turn on one of two coils in one of two polarities. In
addition to these four latch bits, there is one additional bit reserved for   
controlling eddy current damping by shorting one of the two coils. The exact  
time and duration of each motor coil pulse is controlled by the PROM software,
and is turned, prior to burning PROMS, to obtain stable symmetric optical head
rotation characteristics.                                                     
     To obtain stable rotor motion characteristics under varying temperature  
conditions, the motor drive currents are stabilized by a current regulator    
circuit.                                                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
Optics Position Sensors                                                       
                                                                              
     The rotor gear on the rotating optics has four slots cut into it so that 
four LED-photo transistor pairs mounted around the gear can determine if the  
rotor is at 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees (+- 5 degrees). Only one               
photo-transistor will be turned on indicating the position of the rotor. If   
the correct transistor is not illuminated, this condition is reported in the  
data stream by setting the position error flag.                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.3. ANALOG SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS                                            
                                                                              
     Radiation input to a given pyroelectric detector is absorbed by black    
paint covering the detector and subsequently heats the pyroelectric crystals  
moving it towards a new thermal equilibrium temperature, which is ultimately  
attained when the crystal warms enough to conduct and radiate the absorbed    
power to its surroundings. The idealized DC pyroelectric detector generates   
charge across its capacitor plates which is proportional to the total         
temperature change since its last discharge. The charge which is generated    
slowly bleeds off through the load resistor and through the inherent leakage  
of the pyroelectric crystal material. For the NFR detectors the load resistors
are about a thousand times more important than the crystal losses, producing a
charge decay (or droop) time constant of 0.36 s.                              
     As a result of chopping the external radiation field by flipping the     
rotating optics, the NFR detectors are exposed to a radiation input           
approximately given by the waveform in Figure 8(a). During the transition     
between up and down views there is a brief period                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 8. Analog signal waveforms: (a) radiation input to detectors; (b)        
detector response; (c) after filtering by post amps; (d) after decommutation; 
(e) after integration. The plotted signals show the effects of filtering,     
decommutation, and integration, but not the rather large effects of           
amplification. which we excluded for clarity. These waveforms do not          
accurately simulate atmospheric input signals ((a) would have rounded corners 
during atmospheric measurements).                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
during which the detectors receive radiation from the wall of the front       
housing instead of the atmosphere; this contribution is clearly evident as the
short flat spot in the irradiance profile. The approximate response of the    
detectors to the complete irradiance input waveform, shown in Figure 8(b), is 
a consequence of a thermal time constant of about 110 ms and an effective     
droop time constant of 1.1 s (the electrical droop time constant of 0.36 s    
appears to be partly offset from a long time constant component in the        
detector response). A rather drastic change in waveform is seen at the output 
of the post amplifier chain, shown in Figure 8(c), where the effects of the 16
Hz bandpass filter have resulted in a crude differentiation of the input      
signal. The decommutated and integrated waveforms are shown in Figures 8(d)   
and 8(e), respectively. What appear to be large distortions of the input      
signal should be thought of as signal conditioning to achieve maximum         
accuracy. The result of this signal processing is a very narrow bandpass      
filtering, with bandwidth of 0.09 Hz for 5.5 s of integration, which extracts 
the amplitude of the 2-Hz fundamental which is proportional to the net        
radiation flux. As noted earlier, the filtering acts like a crude             
differentiator which, in combination with the integrator, has the beneficial  
characteristic of being insensitive to the details of the transition between  
upward and downward signal levels, and thus insensitive to asymmetries in     
mechanical motions.                                                           
     Significant asymmetry errors can arise when the emission from the wall   
(or ambient blackbody) is considerably different from that of the atmosphere, 
and when the wall pulses seen during up and down transitions are not cancelled
perfectly by the decommutation system because the pulses themselves are either
of different width during up and down transits, or occur with different delay 
times relative to the decommutation waveform, or both. The resultant error is 
proportional to the difference between the average atmospheric flux, F_a, and 
the flux emitted by the wall, F_w. The error is then conveniently             
characterized in terms of the asymmetry factor, given by X_a = net flux       
error/(F_w - F_a). By using large front housing apertures to minimize the size
of the wall pulse, and by adjusting the motor pulse train program to          
symmetrize the delay of up and down wall pulses, the NFR asymmetry factor has 
been reduced to approximately 10^-3 to 5 x 10^-4. When thermal models are used
to estimate the expected difference between F_w and F_a during descent, the   
resultant asymmetry error is almost everywhere negligible compared to other   
sources of error.

4.1. EQUATIONS FOR PREDICTING INSTRUMENT OUTPUT                               
                                                                              
     The object of the NFR calibration measurements is to define the          
instrument behavior sufficiently well so that, given a knowledge of the       
radiation field and the instrument environment, it is possible to predict the 
instrument output. The basic equations relating digital count output in a     
given channel to the external radiation field are essentially as follows:     
                                                                              
     C = Kf(T/T_0) (L_u - L_d) ,                                              
                                                                              
where K is an absolute calibration constant, f(T/T_0) is a relative response  
function describing the instrument response dependence on detector            
temperature, and where L_u,d, the average radiances within the instrument FOV,
are given by                                                                  
                                                                              
L_u,d = integral from 0 to infinity[s_lambda d lambda integral from 0 to      
pi[sin(theta)d theta integral from 0 to 2pi[d phi a_u,d(theta, phi)L(theta,   
phi, lambda)]]],                                                              
                                                                              
where s_lambda is the relative spectral response at wavelength lambda;        
a(theta, phi), relative angular response at theta (angle from vertical), phi  
(azimuth angle); L(theta, phi, lambda), spectral radiance at wavelength lambda
angles theta, phi, where s_lambda and a(theta, phi) are both normalized to    
have unit integrals. Because the NFR detector arrays are sealed in a rigid    
container, there is no dependence of response on external atmospheric         
pressure, and crosstalk between spectral channels is small enough to allow    
relatively accurate corrections.                                              
     A conversion factor is needed to translate the net average radiance into 
an estimate for the net flux for a typical atmosphere; but this is an estimate
based on model results and is not part of the instrument calibration. However,
it has been a habit of the NFR investigators to assume a working conversion   
factor in calculating sensitivity. The practice can be illustrated for a flat 
radiation field, as in the extended area blackbody calibration (EABB)         
configuration. In this case L(theta, phi, lambda) is given by the Planck      
radiance function B_lambda(T) and the integral collapses to the form          
                                                                              
L_u,d = integral from 0 to infinity[s_lambda B_lambda(T_u,d)d lambda integral 
from 0 to pi[sin(theta)d theta integral from 0 to 2pi[d phi a_u,d(theta,      
phi)]]]                                                                       
                                                                              
=                                                                             
                                                                              
integral from 0 to infinity[s_lambda B_lambda(T_u,d)d lambda] ,               
                                                                              
which reduces to the spectrally weighted average of the net Planck radiance.  
For a spectrally flat broadband channel, the average net radiation (in the    
EABB configuration) is just                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
L_n = (L_u - L_d) = sigma/pi (T_u^4 - T_d^4) = 1/pi (F_u - F_d)               
                                                                              
=                                                                             
                                                                              
1/pi F_net .                                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
But in a relatively opaque atmosphere the net radiance varies as the cosine of
the nadir angle and can be written as

     The measured responsivity of an NFR channel is usually quoted in terms of
the ratio Counts/(F_net(EABB)). Since 3*sqroot[2]/4pi is only 6 percent       
larger than pi^-1, the measurement sensitivity to the EABB flux difference is 
almost correct as a measure of sensitivity to atmospheric net flux.           
Appropriate conversion factors will be applied in deriving the best estimate  
of the descent profile of atmospheric flux.                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
4.2. BASIC CALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS                                           
                                                                              
To calculate the instrument output according to the above equations requires  
the following basic measurements:                                             
                                                                              
     (1) Relative angular response for each detector channel.                 
                                                                              
     (2) Relative spectral response for each spectral band.                   
                                                                              
     (3) Relative crosstalk coefficients between neighboring channels.        
                                                                              
     (4) Relative response versus temperature for each channel.               
                                                                              
     (5) Absolute responsivity measurements for each channel using a source   
         which fills the NFR field of view.                                   
                                                                              
     Methods and sample results are described in the following paragraphs.    
                                                                              
                                                                              
Relative Angular Response Measurements                                        
                                                                              
     Angular response was measured using a chopped stationary source of 4     
degree angular diameter in conjunction with an articulating mount for the NFR 
optical head. The articulation was accomplished with crossed rotators scanned 
by computer control to map the solid angle domain with 2 degree resolution.   
The optical head was mounted so that the center of the diamond window remained
fixed during the articulation. The rotating optics assembly was held          
motionless by disabling NFR motor power; a modulated signal was instead       
obtained by chopping the radiation source at a 2-Hz rate in synchronization   
with the NFR decommutation signal. This allowed the NFR data system to acquire
the angular response data, while minimizing the wear and tear on the NFR      
gears. The angular scan was made twice, once using a short wavelength source  
consisting of an integrating sphere illuminated by a quartz-halogen lamp, and 
once using a long wavelength source which is just a small black-body operating
at 128 degrees C. A sample response function is shown in Figure 9. A          
consequence of the NFR optical design (shown in Figure 3) is that the maximum 
response of each detector is in a slightly different location (adjacent       
detectors are separated by 5-6 degrees).                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
Relative Spectral Response                                                    
                                                                              
     Typical spectral response results are shown in Figures 10 and 11 (results
from the final flight instrument calibration were not available at the time of
this writing). The relative spectral response measurements were generally made
using appropriate short or long wave sources, a monochromator to select       
wavelengths, and a reference detector to measure the monochromator output for 
comparison with the NFR measurements. Our primary reference detector is a     
deuterated triglycene sulfate (DTGS) pyroelectric detector with a thorium     
fluoride-coated KBr window. This detector was calibrated by D. Stierwalt at   
the Naval Oceans Systems Center (NOSC) in San Diego. Stierwalt's calibration  
is based on comparisons with a standard spectrally flat detector which uses a 
blackened conical receiver (Eisenman et al., 1963; Eisenman and Bates, 1964). 
A conical detector was borrowed from the NOSC laboratory for additional       
comparisons at Wisconsin. Our comparisons and those at the NOSC laboratory    
were in significant disagreement concerning the long wavelength fall off in   
detector response. For example, at 30 micro m our version of the detector     
response was 40 percent greater than the NOSC value. This discrepancy was     
investigated by making broadband filter measurements at Wisconsin, and        
performing a second calibration using a 2-Hz chopping frequency at NOSC       
(normally a 10-Hz chopping frequency is used at NOSC). Although more recent   
results are in much better agreement (the discrepancy is now less than 10     
percent at 30 micro m), this remains an area of study.                        
     Our spectral response measurements used a quartz halogen source between  
0.25 micro m and 3 micro m, and a 1000 K silicon carbide globar for           
wavelengths from 3 micro m to about                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 9. Sample angular response functions. Here elevation refers to the angle 
above the horizon and azimuth refers to angle about the vertical (90 degree   
azimuth corresponds to the position of the NFR optical head rotation axis).   
During the early part of descent the Sun will have an elevation angle of 25   
degrees, and may intrude into the edge of the NFR field of view.              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
38 micro m. Because of large variations in source output as a function of     
wavelength, it was necessary to use stray light filters at the shortest       
wavelengths, and neutral density filters at intermediate wavelengths, the     
latter to maintain on-scale detector signals. Multiple gratings and           
order-sorting filters were also required. Slit widths were chosen to obtain

A and D, normalized to have a maximum value of one. These were measured for   
the SN01R instrument prior to installation of new detectors. Analysis of final

Fig. 11. Relative spectral response functions for NFR channels B, E, and C.   
Channels B and E use colored glass filters, while C uses an interference      
filter and a long wave CaF2 blocker. Normalization and instrument used are the
same as for Figure 10. Analysis of final flight calibration data and          
additional measurements using the spare NFR instrument and spare filters will 
allow us to define the spectral response much better at longer wavelengths.   
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
high monochromator throughput with moderate spectral resolution (typically 4-5
percent of wavelength). Wavelength calibration was checked with a mercury     
vapor lamp.                                                                   
     Although all the radiation exiting the monochromator was focussed on the 
active area of the reference detector, the NFR detectors, because of optical  
limitations, could only sample a portion of the radiation. Because the        
radiation entering the NFR is not perfectly scrambled, sampling does lead to  
small spectral errors, the magnitude of which can be estimated by repeating   
scans with different NFR orientations, and by comparing overlapping scans with
successive gratings.                                                          
     Accurate measurements of system-level spectral response beyond           
approximately 35 micro m were not practical with the monochromator system     
because of signal-to-noise limitations. To limit uncertainties in relative    
spectral response at longer wavelengths we also used broad-band and diamond   
dust cut-on filters (with known transmissions) in combination with a known    
black-body source. To refine the long wavelength spectral response            
characteristics these measurements of the flight instrument response will be  
supplemented by additional measurements of the spare instrument and spare     
filters and detectors.                                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
Relative Crosstalk Coefficients                                               
                                                                              
     Crosstalk coupling coefficients were determined by exposing the NFR to   
spectrally independent sets of stimuli, then measuring the response of all    
channels. For any given stimulus vector there exists a direct detector        
response vector R, which is transformed by crosstalk matrix A_ij to a         
gain-corrected count response vector C', with elements                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
               C_i' =C_i/g_i = SUM[ A_ij * R_j ],                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
where g_i is a gain conversion factor for channel i. When it is possible to   
stimulate directly just a single channel, then the coupling coefficients are

The approximation of R_j by C_j/g_j is warranted because the crosstalk        
coefficients are rather small (just a few tenths of 1 percent or less).       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Relative Temperature Dependence                                               
                                                                              
     To measure responsivity as a function of temperature the NFR optical head
was mounted on a thermoelectric cooler within a sealed chamber which was      
evacuated to maximize the performance of the temperature control system. While
exposed to a constant radiation source the instrument temperature was changed 
from -20 degrees C to +50 degrees C. The test was carried out in two parts:   
first, extended area black-body sources were used and the NFR motor was used  
to chop between the two sources; and second, an external chopped quartz-      
halogen source was used and the NFR motor was turned off. A comparison of     
these two test results shows that the NFR motor operation does not vary with  
temperature sufficiently to have a significant effect on responsivity. We did 
find, however, that the NFR spectral response does vary somewhat with         
temperature, leading to different temperature dependencies in different       
channels.

Fig. 12. Temperature dependence of responsivity for NFR channels A (3-500     
micro m) and D (14-35 micro m). Results were obtained using Extended Area     
Black-Body (EABB) sources and NFR rotational chopping. The difference between 
these two curves is presumably a result of temperature dependence in the      
spectral characteristics of channel D. The response curve of channel A is     
dominated by the relative temperature dependence of detector responsivity.    
Both curves were normalized to have a maximum of one.                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
compares the response of channel A with that of channel D. Most channels, when
illuminated mainly with in-band radiation, behave approximately like channel  
A. The responsivity decline at temperatures beyond 50 degrees C is            
sufficiently uncertain to warrant further investigation using the spare       
detector package.                                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
Absolute Responsivity Measurements                                            
                                                                              
     The absolute calibrations used sources of well-known spectral content    
which uniformly fill the field of view of the NFR, and which are spectrally   
shaped to provide strong in-band stimulation.                                 
                                                                              
     Long Wave Channels. Long wavelength channels A (3.5-500 micro m) and D   
(14-35 micro m) were calibrated using two distinct black-body source          
configurations: one configuration uses a pair of extended area black-body     
(EABB) sources made by Advanced Kinetics, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA), the second   
configuration used a pair of black-body cavities adapted from sources used on 
a previous University of Wisconsin Pioneer Venus experiment (Sromovsky et al.,
1980). In both cases the pair of sources was arranged to fill the NFR field of
view at 'up' and 'down' positions, and the NFR flipped between them using the 
rotating optical system. The EABB sources are 6-inch x 6-inch aluminum plates 
with a blackened honeycomb emitting surface and three independent             
thermoelectric servo systems trying to maintain a constant and spatially      
uniform temperature. Temperature measurements were made using platinum        
resistance thermometers. The emittance of the EABB sources is better than     
0.995 by manufacturer calculation, but not independently measured. A concern  
with the EABB sources is the existence of temperature gradients within the    
aluminum radiating plate. The three independent temperature monitor readouts  
on each plate typically differ by 0.1-0.2 K. The platinum resistance sensors  
within the EABBs may also have experienced some minor shift in calibration due
to repetitive thermal cycling. A comparison with recently calibrated precision
thermistors indicates that such a shift is probably no more than 0.1 to 0.2 K.
Both emissivity and temperature uncertainties are not expected to create      
calibration errors greater than 1 although this estimate itself is            
sufficiently uncertain to warrant comparison with the independent set of      
cavity calibration sources.                                                   
     The cavity sources are relatively small, and thick-walled, leading to    
very uniform temperatures within the cavity. The cavity temperatures are      
monitored with YSI 44031 precision thermistors with a guaranteed              
interchangability of 0.1 K with respect to an absolute temperature scale. To  
minimize offset errors we compared a set of six thermistors, and selected four
which were in closest agreement for use as cavity monitors (these differed by 
a maximum of 0.03-0.06 K). The cavity emittance, calculated according to      
formulas developed by Sydnor (1970), using paint properties measured by       
Stierwalt (1966), is estimated to be approximately 0.99, not counting the     
additional enhancement resulting from reflection of cavity radiation off the  
NFR back into the cavity. The disadvantage of the cavity sources relative to  
the EABB sources is that the former can only be heated above room temperature,
while the latter can be cooled as well as heated.                             
     The results of these calibrations for the SN02R2 instrument, summarized  
in Table IV, are very encouraging in that both source configurations lead to  
essentially the same calibration for both longwave channels (within 0.2       
percent and 0.5 percent for A and D, respectively). This is better agreement  
than the estimated uncertainty of about 1 percent (based on a temperature     
difference uncertainty of 0.2 K and an emissivity uncertainty of 0.5 percent).
The responsivities in this table are calculated by dividing the digital count 
output by the net flux input, where the net flux input is 'in-band' net flux  
calculated by integrating the source emission spectrum over the relative      
spectral response of each channel, using a normalization of unity at the      
maximum responsivity. This table does not show EABB and cavity calibration    
results for channels B and E because the long wave sources are poorly suited  
for calibration of these short wave channels. (Most of the source energy is   
outside their spectral bandpasses making in-band flux calculations extremely  
dependent on details of the long wave cutoffs of these channels.)             
                                                                              
Short Wave Channels. The calibration of the solar channels B (0.3-3.5 micro m)
and E (0.6-3.5 micro m) is based on a spectral irradiance standard which      
illuminates a standard diffusing plate filling the NFR field of view. The     
irradiance standard is a 40 W quartz-halogen lamp calibrated by Optronics

Laboratories, Inc. of Orlando Florida. The calibration extends from 0.25 to   
3.5 micro m, but is most accurate at wavelengths less than 2.5 micro m. A     
water filter was placed between the lamp and the diffuser plate to block      
radiation at uncalibrated and at inaccurately calibrated wavelengths. The     
spectral transmission of the water filter was measured using the monochromator
and a pyroelectric detector. The diffuser is a freshly prepared 6 x 10-inch x 
5 cm thick Halon surface compressed to a density of 1 g cm^-3 to obtain       
standard reflectivity properties (Weidner et al., 1985). Over most of the     
visible spectrum, the surface reflectivity is approximately 0.99. Given the   
known source intensity, transmission of the water filter, distance to the     
diffusing screen, and reflection properties of the screen, it is possible to  
calculate the in-band flux in the short wave channels with an RSS uncertainty 
of about 2.5 percent (calculated as the RSS of the following contributions:   
1.3 percent NBS uncertainty, 1 percent transfer uncertainty, 1.75 percent     
uncertainty in water filter transmission, 0.5 percent uncertainty in surface  
reflectivity). The calibration was performed twice: once with the radiation   
source chopped and the NFR rotor immobilized, and a second time with the      
source steady and the NFR chopping. The results of the absolute calibration of
channels B and E are shown in Table IV.                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Channel C Calibration. The excess thermal channel(C), with a spectral bandpass
from 3.5 to 5.8 micro m, was calibrated using both long wavelength broadband  
sources and also using a restricted wavelength source. The restricted source  
used a 1000 K globar filtered to restrict radiation to be within the channel C
spectral band, then input to a gold diffusing sphere to provide the angular   
distribution needed to fill the NFR field of view. Because the output of the  
integrating sphere cannot be calculated with sufficient accuracy, it had to be
measured. This was done using a reference detector calibrated at short        
wavelengths (using the same procedure as carried out to calibrate channels B  
and E) and adjusted for its relative spectral response. The uncertainty of    
this calibration is approximately 3.4 percent, estimated as the root sum      
square of the following uncertainties: 2.5 percent uncertainty in reference   
detector calibration at calibration wavelengths, 2 percent uncertainty in     
relative spectral response of the reference detector, and 1 percent variation 
in integrating sphere output due to NFR-reference detector reflectivity       
differences). The result of this calibration differs by only 1.9 percent from 
the average calibration using cavity and EABB broadband sources (see Table    
IV). This is a gratifying agreement between two completely independent        
calibration methods, one ultimately related to an NBS spectral irradiance

5.1. SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS                                                   
                                                                              
     The Galileo Probe will enter the atmosphere near the evening terminator; 
the initial solar zenith angle for NFR measurements will be approximately 65  
degrees and will increase with time as Jupiter's rotation carried the Probe   
into sunset, which will occur near the 10-bar level. Depending on the Probe   
spin rate, the strong azimuthal variations in scattered solar radiation may be
evident in channels B and E above the 1-bar level (Tomasko and Doose, 1988).  
Deeper in the atmosphere, the direct solar beam and azimuthal variations will 
both become insignificant. Gains on channels B and E are low enough to handle 
relatively large azimuthal variations, but not low enough to handle the direct
solar beam (which will in the worst case only be near the edge of the NFR     
field of view (see Figure 9).                                                 
     Predicted net flux profiles under expected descent conditions are shown  
in Figure 13. (These are only tentative estimates which will be considerably  
refined prior to Jupiter encounter.) Profiles for long wave channels A, D, and
C (Pollack, 1986) are from calculations which do not include cloud opacity.   
Profiles for short wave channels B and E (Tomasko and Doose, 1988) do include 
effects of cloud opacity and haze, with boundaries as indicated in the figure.
Expected measurement noise in individual net flux data samples is indicated by
error bars on each profile. Errors due to calibration uncertainties are not   
shown. Detector noise (actually, this is mainly Johnson noise in the load     
resistors) is almost everywhere the dominant noise source, and quantization   
and asymmetry errors are almost everywhere insignificant. During thermal      
transients, there may also be noise contributions from detector arcing, as    
described later.                                                              
     At the top of Figure 13 is a tabulation of the number of samples expected
for each atmospheric layer. For example, within the NH3 ice cloud between 300 
and 700 mb we expect 29 net flux measurements, but less than two each of Up   
Flux, Black-body Calibrate, and Analog Zero measurements. The vertical        
resolution of net flux measurements is high enough to allow some noise        
reduction through averaging, especially at the higher pressures (where it is  
needed the most). Uncertainty in calibration, offset correction, and crosstalk
couplings are, of course, systematic errors which cannot be reduced by        
vertical averaging.                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 13. Predicted profiles of net flux versus pressure during descent into   
Jupiter's atmosphere. Calculations for channels A, D, and C did not account   
for cloud opacity. Clouds were included in simulating measurements in the     
solar channels B and E. The cloud and haze boundaries used in these           
calculations are indicated by vertical lines and labelled by cloud            
composition. The number of samples of net flux (NF) and up flux (UF) data in  
each layer is listed across the top of the figure. Error bars indicate the    
expected measurement noise. Calibration errors are not included. The rapid    
decline of signal in channels B and E near 10 bars is a consequence of the    
Sun's setting.                                                                
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
5.2. DETECTOR ARCING                                                          
                                                                              
     NFR detector crystals develop potential differences proportional to the  
rate of change of detector temperature and to the bleed resistance. The       
electroded part of the crystal does not develop a substantial potential       
because the load resistors are very efficient at bleeding off the charge. The 
time constant for bleeding off charge from the unelectroded regions of the    
crystals is about 1000 times longer, so that thermal ramp-induced potentials  
can become large enough to cause sudden discharges. These discharges can      
become large enough so that a single event can invalidate a 5.5-s data sample.
Fortunately, these events are likely to be relatively infrequent, occurring   
mainly during the second 5 min of descent, between the point of the maximum   
negative thermal ramp and the point of minimum detector temperature. This     
covers an approximate pressure range from 0.5 to 1.5 bars (see Figure 13).    
Only channels C and E exhibited arcing noise during laboratory testing of the 
flight instrument.                                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
5.3. EXPECTED PERFORMANCE OF THE DETECTOR PACKAGE SEAL                        
                                                                              
     The first objective of the seal, preventing pressure perturbations from  
reaching the detectors, appears to be met even with a relatively poor seal.   
This inference is based on comparing wind tunnel tests of an unsealed detector
with those of a poorly sealed detector leaking at a rate of approximately     
10^-5 cc s^-1 (xenon equivalent). A much better seal is required to prevent   
large crosstalk couplings and responsivity variation. With any more than 100  
mb of He in the detector package crosstalk would be five times the vacuum     
level and responsivity would be degraded by 15 percent.  (Hydrogen has        
approximately the same effect as He.) To make these effects negligible the    
seal should keep the thermal conductivity of the gas within the detector      
package no higher than that of air (about 1/5 that of helium).                
     The upper bound of the detector leak rate measured by mass spectrometry  
shortly after sealing (in February 1989), is approximately 7 x 10^-10 cc (of  
Xe at STP) s^-1 with a pressure difference of approximately 840 mb. Given an  
initial volume of approximately 0.033 cc of gas (the internal volume of the   
detector package), and assuming that the leak is viscous in nature, we find   
that after 6 years of leaking the detector package will still retain about 100
mb of Xe. We measured the rate at which helium leaks into the package by      
watching the NFR response to a fixed radiation source as the helium diffuses  
into the detector package. After 23 hours of exposure to 1 bar of helium we   
saw a response drop of only 0.5 percent, implying a maximum He diffusion leak 
rate of about 10^-7 cc s^-1 (this rate takes several hours to become          
established). Because tests with a mockup detector seal show no significant   
difference between He and H2 diffusion rates, we can conclude that no more    
than 10-20 mb of Jovian He and H2, combined will leak into the detector during
descent. This is well below the level which could affect detector response,   
especially in the presence of 100 mb of Xe, which buffers the conductivity of 
the lighter gases.
