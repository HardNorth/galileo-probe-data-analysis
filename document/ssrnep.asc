Abstract.                                                                     
                                                                              
     The objective of the Nephelometer Experiment aboard the Probe of the     
Galileo mission is to explore the vertical structure and microphysical        
properties of the clouds and hazes in the atmosphere of Jupiter along the     
descent trajectory of the Probe (nominally from 0.1 to > 10 bars). The        
measurements, to be obtained at least every kilometer of the Probe descent,   
will provide the bases for inferences of mean particle sizes, particle number 
densities (and hence, opacities, mass densities, and columnar mass loading)   
and, for non-highly absorbing particles, for distinguishing between solid and 
liquid particles. These quantities, especially the location of the cloud      
bases, together with other quantities derived from this and other experiments 
aboard the Probe, will not only yield strong evidence for the composition of  
the particles, but, using thermochemical models, for species abundances as    
well. The measurements in the upper troposphere will provide 'ground truth'   
data for correlation with remote sensing instruments aboard the Galileo       
Orbiter vehicle. The instrument is carefully designed and calibrated to       
measure the light scattering properties of the particulate clouds and hazes at
scattering angles of 5.8, 16, 40, 70, and 178 degrees. The measurement        
sensitivity and accuracy is such that useful estimates of mean particle radii 
in the range from about 0.2 to 20 microns can be inferred. The instrument     
will detect the presence of typical cloud particles with radii of about 1.0   
microns, or larger, at concentrations of less than 1 cm^3.                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                  1. Introduction                             
                                                                              
     The Galileo Jupiter mission atmospheric Probe (O'Neil and Mitchell, 1983;
Givens et al., 1983) includes a Nephelometer as part of the Probe instrument  
complement. The scientific objective of the Nephelometer experiment* is to    
explore the vertical structure and microphysical properties of the clouds and 
hazes in the Jovian atmosphere. The experiment will provide evidence for the  
existence or absence of particulates along the descent trajectory of the Probe
(nominally from altitudes corresponding to ambient pressures of 0.1 bars to   
greater than 10 bars). It will yield data that will be used to infer the      
properties of these particulates, including mean size and particle number     
density, and to differentiate between liquid and solid particles (i.e.,       
spherical and non-spherical).

Avrin, Martin Marietta Astronautics Group, Jacques E. Blamont, Service        
d'Aeronomie du C.N.R.S., David Colburn, San Jose State University Foundation, 
Gerald Grams, Georgia Institute of Technology, and James Pollack, NASA/Ames   
Research Center.                                                              
                                                                              
In conjunction with data from other Galileo Jupiter Probe and Orbiter         
experiments, the Nephelometer measurements will be used to confirm the        
consistency of predictions of the effective particle indices of refraction,   
including absorption. Approximate cloud opacities at a wavelength of 0.9      
microns, a measure of the local cloud mass density along the descent          
trajectory, and the total columnar mass loading in each cloud will be         
obtained. All of the above results, together with the cloud base locations,   
that will be well documented by this experiment, will not only yield strong   
evidence for inferring the gross composition of the particles, but, by        
comparison with thermochemical models, will constrain the particles' species  
abundances. Finally. the data will provide in situ information about particles
in the upper levels of the troposphere at the Probe entry site to provide     
'ground truth' data for correlation with remote sensing experiments aboard the
Galileo Jupiter Orbiter vehicle.                                              
     The launch of the Galileo spacecraft took place on October 18, 1989, and 
the Probe will enter the Jovian atmosphere at a latitude of 6.5 N at about    
local Jovian sunset (nominally at 22:11 UT) on December 7, 1995. It is        
expected that, after deployment, Nephelometer measurements will be obtained,  
at a minimum, every kilometer for at least 100 km or more during the course of
the Probe descent. In the following sections we summarize the presently held  
views of the clouds and hazes of Jupiter and what we may expect to learn from 
our experiment, describe the design of the instrument, and discuss its        
calibration, testing, and expected performance.                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                 2. Background                                
                                                                              
      Many of the aspects of the nature, structure, and variability of the    
clouds and hazes in the troposphere of Jupiter at pressures less than 5 bars  
are subjects of very active ongoing discussion in the literature. (See, for   
example, West et al., 1986, who have recently provided an excellent review of 
the status of knowledge of the Jovian clouds and aerosols; Carlson et al.,    
1987, 1988, 1990; Cunningham et al., 1988; West, 1988: West et al., 1989; Del 
Genio and McGrattan, 1990). The foundation for ideas of the aerosol and cloud 
structure comes from equilibrium thermochemical models that depend on the     
abundances of relevant species and the atmospheric structure functions        
(atmospheric temperature versus pressure curves). By assuming that pertinent  
species (N, O, and S) are present with solar abundances, the presence of three
cloud layers in the upper troposphere are predicted by such models (cf. Lewis,
1969a, b; Weidenschilling and Lewis, 1973). NH3 condenses at the altitude     
corresponding to a pressure near 0.7 bars, mixed NH3 and H2S and/or ammonia   
polysulfides are condensed at about 2 bars, and H2O condenses at about 5 bars.
The precise condensed particle compositions and pressure levels of these cloud
bases are dependent on the actual local species abundances and temperature    
structure.                                                                    
     Model calculations based on microwave wavelength measurements have       
determined that NH3 is undersaturated above the NH3 cloud base predicted for  
solar abundance and at high levels (0.3-0.5 bars), depleted relative to solar 
abundance at 0.5 to 2 bars, and superabundant at higher pressures (de Pater,  
1986). The depletions appear to be due to chemistry, cloud physics, and       
atmospheric dynamics. Taking these into account, some investigators currently 
believe that the NH3 abundance above the clouds may be essentially solar      
(Carlson, 1990, private communication), so that the abundance at lower levels 
in the clouds is solar or larger, although there is some question about the   
very deep NH3 mixing ratio. Most investigators agree that the current         
experimental data do not yield reliable information on sulfur abundances and  
that, therefore, they do not provide constraints on the NH4SH cloud, even on  
the question of its existence. From the analysis of airborne telescope and    
Voyager IRIS spectra Bjoraker et al. (1986), inferred an H2O abundance        
approximately 50 times less than solar abundance in the 2 to 6 bar region of  
Jupiter. Such an abundance would shift the predicted water cloud to a level   
much higher than that predicted for a solar abundance atmosphere, perhaps up  
to the 2 bar level. However, Carlson et al. (1990) have reanalyzed the same   
experimental data (including cloud scattering that had not been considered in 
the earlier analyses) and conclude instead that the H2O abundance is solar or 
greater, which would place the cloud at a level close to the original level   
discussed above.                                                              
     The equilibrium thermochemical models alone cannot yield realistic       
descriptions of the vertical or horizontal cloud structures, or predict       
details such as particle sizes and number densities. They cannot give the     
details of particle formation or destruction, or discuss the apparently large 
spatial and temporal variations. These characteristics are intimately related 
to the local and regional atmospheric dynamics, precipitation and the         
concentration of condensation nuclei, and involve the cloud microphysics. For 
example, suggestions have been made that molecular weight differentiation and 
latent heat release in condensible species may control the dynamics in the    
cloud regions (Barcilon and Gierasch, 1970; Gierasch, 1976; Ingersoll, 1976;  
Gierasch and Conrath, 1985, 1987), and that moist convection processes are    
important (Stoker, 1986; Lunine and Hunten, 1987; Del Genio and McGrattan,    
1990). Due to the large range of length scales involved and the lack of       
fundamental information such as the concentration of condensation nuclei, the 
prediction from first principles of the detailed cloud properties appears to  
be well beyond the capability of existing dynamical models in the absence of  
in situ measurements (Glerasch, 1988). The comparison of remote sensing       
observations of scattered sunlight and thermal radiation with radiative       
transfer calculations provide several constraints on the cloud structures in  
Jupiter's troposphere. The complexity of the cloud structure, along with      
significant infrared opacity over most wavelengths, has, however, made the    
unique inversion of the remote sensing observations difficult. This           
uncertainty is evident in the continuing discussion in the literature among   
different investigators using the same and different data sets.               
     The following summary of the clouds of Jupiter in the upper troposphere  
is based on presently available data and analyses (West et al., 1986; Tomasko,
1989, private conversation; Carlson, 1990, private conversation).             
     Haze is present in the stratosphere above, and perhaps persists down into
the tropopause. This haze consists of meteoritic particles and/or energetic   
particle impact-generated or photochemically-produced aerosols with a mean    
radius of about 0.1 microns and a total optical depth of about 0.1 to 0.3 at  
visible wavelengths. There are more particles and greater optical depths at   
higher latitudes, presumably due to the more intense radiation belts and      
larger number of energetic particle impacts (Tomasko, 1989, private           
communication).                                                               
     The pressure range from 200 to 700 mb contains the clouds and hazes that 
form the layer observed at visible wavelengths, although the precise level of 
the visible clouds within this range is a subject of some discussion (West et 
al., 1986). Also, a comparison of longitudinal structures and zonal motions of
features in infrared maps and visible images suggests that the visible        
features have tops throughout this pressure range (cf. Magalhaes et al.,      
1990). Essentially no holes permitting direct viewing to deeper levels at     
visible wavelengths exist in this layer down to very small spatial scales     
(West et al., 1986). Two particle populations are believed to exist in this   
pressure range. A diffuse ubiquitous layer of particles with mean radii of    
about 1-2 microns is present and may extend up to about 200-300 mb at low     
latitudes; this layer is required by the results of studies of scattered      
visible sunlight. The optical depth of this layer of particles at visible     
wavelengths is between 2 and 10, and particle densities (based on opacity     
arguments) are estimated to be of the order of 100-1000 cm^-3. The absence of 
identifiable spectral features of NH3 ice particles implies that these        
aerosols may not be composed completely of NH3 (Orton et al., 1982; West et   
al., 1989). However, the particles may consist                                
of NH3 with large occlusions, mixtures, or coatings, consisting, for example, 
largely of photochemical products of NH3 such as N2H4, or of various proposed 
chromophores or other species.                                                
     A layer of larger particles (with radii of 3-100 microns that is         
horizontally patchy and confined to a fraction of the gas scale height above  
the NH3 condensation level at approximately 700 mb is required by observations
in the thermal infrared (cf. Gierasch et al., 1986). The zonally-averaged     
latitudinal variation of the optical cloud depth of this cloud layer          
correlates well with the zonally averaged visible reflectivity ('the belt-zone
structure of the planet') and the zonally-averaged NH3 abundance at the 700 mb
level (Glerasch et al., 1986). The composition of the particles is presumably 
NH3 and the optical depth at visible wavelengths is comparable to or less than
that of the diffuse layer. Particle number densities are estimated to be of   
the order of 1-10 cm^-3.                                                      
     The characterization of clouds at deeper levels is poorly constrained by 
remote sensing observations of cloud and aerosol structure. An inhomogeneous  
time-variable cloud is thought to be located in the vicinity of the altitude  
corresponding to a pressure of about 2 bars. Its composition is not well      
defined by observations. If the abundance of H2S is solar, then this cloud    
contains NH4SH and/or polysulfides particles. In addition, if the H2O         
abundance is appreciably depleted from solar, then, as mentioned above, this  
cloud may contain appreciable amounts of H2O. The cloud is patchy, may also   
contain chromophores, and also contributes to the appearance of the 5 micron  
images. The vertical extent of this cloud is ill-defined, and there are no    
estimates of particle sizes.                                                  
     An H2O or H2O-NH3 cloud may exist in the 4 to 6 bar region. If the mixing
ratio of O is equal to or greater than corresponding solar mixing ratios, then
this cloud may be quite massive, containing ice crystals of the order of a    
micron in size near its top and large droplets of the order of 100 microns or 
greater in size precipitating, perhaps, from the cloud base. This cloud, if it
exists, is also spatially inhomogeneous, perhaps almost disappearing in the   
regions of the 5 micron features (West et al., 1986). It should be emphasized 
that there is only weak experimental evidence for the existence of this cloud,
evidence for which other explanations may be made without invoking its        
existence.                                                                    
     From the above discussion it is clear that there are many uncertainties  
about the clouds of Jupiter. By making in-situ measurements the Nephelometer  
experiment will help to resolve a number of the outstanding questions. The    
experiment is expected to yield information on the number of clouds, their    
location, especially of their bases, the amount of material in these clouds   
and its vertical distribution, the particle sizes and number densities (and   
hence opacities) in the clouds, and indications of the physical form of the   
particles. These results can then be used in models to attempt to obtain      
species abundances, to explain radiation balances, and to investigate         
atmospheric dynamics.

3.1. GENERAL                                                                  
                                                                              
     The Nephelometer is designed to achieve the desired objectives by        
comparing simultaneous measurements of the light scattered at five angles from
a well-defined volume of atmosphere in the vicinity of the Probe with         
theoretical models of light scattering from particulate matter. A similar     
approach was successfully used by Marov et al. (1980), for measurements made  
from the Venera Probes in the Venus atmosphere.                               
     A cloud or haze is characterized by the way in which it scatters light.  
In particular, each unit of volume illuminated by a beam of light will scatter
the light at a given angle, theta, in proportion to the product of the        
particle number density, n, and the probability of the particles in that      
volume to scatter light into a unit solid angle at that angle, the            
differential scattering cross section, [d sigma/d Omega]_theta. The           
Nephelometer measured this quantity, at five angles. Measurements are then    
compared with calculations of the same quantities for model aerosols to obtain
the best agreement with the experimental data. Results of such comparisons    
yield mean particle sizes, particle number densities, and indications of      
non-sphericity of the particles and/or absorption in the particles. The       
accuracy with which these quantities can be determined depends on the accuracy
of the experimental data and, to a small extent, on the availability of       
subsidiary information, for example hints or particle composition from other  
experiments on the Probe. A description of one method of performing such      
comparisons to obtain the best fit to the data is given by Marov et al.       
(1980).                                                                       
     The instrument contains the following components: (1) pulsed solid state 
laser light sources, (2) solid state scattered light detectors, (3)           
collimating, defining, collecting optics, including a deployable axicon       
(axially-symmetric conical) mirror system, and spectral filters, (4) optical  
alignment, surface condensation and source output monitors, (5) other         
housekeeping measurement systems to monitor instrument operation and          
performance, and (6) analog and digital electronics circuitry and power       
supplies. The mechanical structure, deployment system, and thermal design     
assure that the instrument will survive the severe launch, cruise phase.      
atmospheric entry, and descent environments.                                  
    A number of complicating factors must be considered in the design of the  
instrument. For example, the required high sensitivity to small scattered     
light signals and the relatively large background light levels (up to 10^6    
times as large as the minimum signal levels), as well as the large dynamic    
range of expected signals (of the order of 10^5 to 10^6), necessitate very    
careful signal processing. An irradiating light beam collimated highly enough 
for the measurement of small angle scattering in the forward direction, yet   
powerful enough to provide sufficient scattered light for measurement of the  
relatively small scattering at wide angles is required. This requirement is   
further complicated by the need to reduce instrumentally scattered light, the 
severely limited space, and the need for reliable source operation after an   
extended multiple-year cruise phase. In addition, large zero-signal baseline  
effects may be caused by electrical signals induced by the operation of high  
power pulsed sources near very sensitive detector circuitry. There is a need  
to survive not only the severe launch, cruise phase, and atmospheric entry    
environments, but also the intense high-energy radiation in passing through   
the Jovian                                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 1. Galileo Probe Nephelometer instrument. The instrument is positioned on
a holding fixture. The forward scatter unit, shown with its mirror arm        
assembly in the deployed position, is directly mounted on the back scatter    
unit. For reference, the cylindrical electronics unit is 18.8 cm in diameter  
and 16.5 cm high.                                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
radiation belts. The effects of this radiation on the reliability and         
stability of electronic components and circuitry need to be carefully         
considered in the instrument design. Finally, there are the requirements of   
relatively low allowable weight, space, power, and data rate.                 
     Physically, the instrument is constructed in three parts, a vented sensor
head containing the forward scatter unit, a vented sensor head containing the 
backward scatter configuration, and a pressure-tight electronics unit         
containing the bulk of the electronics. A photograph is shown in Figure 1. The
scaled unit is capable of withstanding pressures of greater than 20 bars with 
negligible leakage. The vented sensor heads, containing components also       
capable of withstanding pressures greater than 20 bars, are connected to the  
electronics unit with cables terminating in pressure-tight connectors sealed  
into the wall of the electronics unit. Both units are mounted onto the aft    
side of the instrument shelf of the Probe. The faces of the sensor units are  
flush with the Probe skin, and the

Instrument characteristics. The dynamic range for all channels is             
approximately 10^6, and the mean source wavelength for both forward and       
backscatter sources is approximately 904 nm. The effective sampling volume    
decreases for strong signals as the number of sampled pulses is reduced.

instrument is oriented on the Probe so that sampled volumes extend out of the 
Probe essentially radially. A 'closeout' structure is used to seal the edges  
of the sensor faces to the Probe skin. A deployable arm containing the axicon 
mirror segments, as well as the pyrotechnic pin puller that activates the     
deployment mechanism, extends from the upper corner of the top of the sensor  
unit out through the Probe skin. This assembly allows forward scattering      
sample volumes to be situated in relatively undisturbed air, outboard of flow 
regimes near the skin of the Probe in which aerodynamic effects may severely  
modify the particle size distributions with respect to the true ambient       
free-stream distributions. Calculation of these effects for the present case  
have been performed using modified methods similar to those described by Chow 
(1979). The detector external windows and the axicon mirror assembly are      
electrically heated continuously during Probe descent to prevent condensation 
of atmospheric vapors. During transit to Jupiter and the period of high       
heating on entry into the Jovian atmosphere, the Probe is immersed in the heat
shield with the axicon mirror arm stowed in its undeployed position. Targets  
are mounted on the inner surface of the heat shield, scattering fixed amounts 
of light from the forward and backward irradiating sources. This scattered    
light is measured by the instrument, permitting checks of calibration         
stability during the long test and cruise phases of the mission, and shortly  
before entry into the Jovian atmosphere. Initiation of the Nephelometer       
experiment begins after entry and deployment of the Probe parachute, removal  
of the Probe from the heat shield, and deployment of the axicon mirror arm.   
     The instrument characteristics are summarized in Table I. A preliminary  
description of the instrument has been published earlier (Yeates et al, 1985).
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.2. OPTICAL DESIGN                                                           
                                                                              
     A schematic of the optical system is shown in Figure 2, which illustrates
the scattering configuration for each of the four forward scattering channels,
Figure 2(a), and the backward scatter channel, Figure 2(b). For each channel  
the effective scattering volume is defined by the intersection of the source  
beam with the field of view of the detector. In the case of the forward       
scattering channels, light scattered in the forward direction impinges on a   
portion of an axially-symmetric conical mirror (axicon) and is reflected      
backward through a window onto the collecting lens of the detector assembly.  
The light is focussed at the plane of a field stop aperture through which it  
passes onto a spectral filter and into the detector. For the measurement of   
back-scattered light no mirror is necessary. The source beam and collecting   
lens optical axes are parallel and displaced from each other so that only     
light scattered from the source beam at very wide angles, close to 180        
degrees, is collected. A slightly displaced off-axis aperture is used. The    
scattering configuration and the effect of the aperture are shown             
schematically in Figure 2(b). Rays a are characteristic of light scattered at 
180 degrees (from an infinite distance along the irradiating beam), focussed  
onto and passing through the aperture onto the spectral filter and detector.  
Ray c represents an extremal ray, back-scattered at a minimal angle less than 
180 degrees, that, after passing through the lens, just grazes the edge of the
aperture. Rays b, back-scattered at an angle between the minimal angle of ray 
c and 180 degrees, are                                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 2. Schematics of scattering configurations. (a) Forward scatter          
configuration. The mean scattering angle, theta, is defined by the conical    
mirror angle, theta/2, and the angular acceptance angle, alpha, by the        
aperture that determines the angular limits at which scattered light rays may 
enter the detector. (b) Backward scatter configuration. Ray a corresponds to  
light back-scattered from the source beam at theta_a = 180 degrees. Ray c is  
an extremal ray, back-scattered from the source beam at an angle, theta_c,    
defined by the off-axis aperture, and ray b is for back-scattering at an      
intermediate angle theta_b. The mean scattering angle and the angular         
acceptance function are determined from ray tracing calculations, or          
empirically, from target scans of the scatter volume.                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
characteristic of all other rays scattered at intermediate angles passing     
through the aperture.                                                         
     The configuration of the components, the aperture, lens characteristics, 
masking, and source beam dimensions determine the angular acceptance range, +-
alpha, for light scattered at the angle theta (fixed by the mirror angle      
theta/2, for forward scattered light). Ray-tracing calculations, verified by  
measurements performed by passing diffusely scattering targets through the    
sample volumes, have established that the angular acceptance functions for the
four forward scattering channels are essentially symmetrical with mean values 
of 5.82, 16.01, 40.01, and 70.00 degrees. Full widths at half maximum for the 
corresponding angular acceptance functions are 0.64, 1.08, 1.72. and 1.76     
degrees, respectively. The effective angular acceptance function of the       
back-scatter unit, determined by scanning the scattering volume with a        
diffusely reflecting target, is slightly asymmetric with a mean value of 178.1
degrees and a full width at half maximum of 4.0 degrees (cf. Ragent and       
Blamont, 1980).                                                               
     A cutaway view of the vented optical sensor head and electronic unit is  
shown in Figure 3. The forward scatter assembly is mounted above the backward 
scatter assembly. A solid state laser light source was used in each assembly. 
This type of source was especially chosen to provide the small effective      
source size necessary to produce the low divergence light beam required for   
small angle forward scattering measurements. This source, a gallium arsenide  
laser injection diode (LID), Laser Diode Lab. Model LID-60, was selected      
because of its small active area (2.03 x 10^-4 by 7.62 x 10^-3 cm), its high  
optical power output (approximately 2 W peak when driven by a 200 ns wide, 9 A
current pulse), and a favorable match between its spectral output             
(approximately 904 +- 5.0 nm) and the spectral response of the detectors. The 
output of the light source is collected by an anti-reflection coated lens     
corrected for spherical aberration. For the forward scattering unit the light 
output is further collimated by a 40 cm long baffled tube to reduce scattered 
light and to keep effective beam divergence to acceptable levels. The         
backscatter unit source-lens combination is recessed 10.2 cm into the         
backscatter housing so that no portion of the forward scatter mirror assembly 
or its mounting configuration is in the field of view of the backscatter unit.
     The reflecting axicon mirror assembly, mounted on the end of the         
deployable arm, consists of four coaxial 90 degree segments of the frustums of
gold-coated conical mirrors, each reflecting scattered light at a designated  
angle to one of the forward scatter channels. A hole through the center of the
assembly allows unscattered light in the source beam to pass to the atmosphere
outside of the collection volume. As mentioned above, the axicon mirrors are  
electrically heated during Probe descent to reduce the risk of condensation of
atmospheric vapors onto their surfaces.                                       
     A grid-heated glass window on each of the forward and backward-scattering
units helps to protect the detector assemblies from thermal effects, surface  
condensation, and electrostatic charging. These assemblies consist of light   
collecting lenses, lens masks, field stops, filters, and detectors. The lenses
are light-weight, moderate resolution, acrylic Fresnel lenses, each cut to the
same shape and size as the projection of the corresponding axicon element in  
the exterior plane of the detector module. Lens masks are used to further     
define the shape of the scattering volume. Field stops are placed at the      
paraxial image points of the collector lenses. In the case of the backscatter 
channel the field stop is slightly displaced from the lens axis so as to admit
light scattered from angles of about 176 to 180 degrees. The detectors are    
silicon p-i-n detectors (E. G. and G. Electrooptics Division Model 200),      
back-biased at 90 V, with a responsivity of about 0.64 A W^-1 at 900 nm, and a
rise time of 10 ns.

than at wavelengths near that of the laser diode are used as cover glasses for
the detectors. The bandpass curve for these filters is essentially flat with a
full width at half maximum of about 66 nm, centered on 904 nm at a temperature
of about 20 degrees C. The width is sufficient to make allowance for          
non-perpendicular rays impinging on the filter, as well as wavelength shifts  
due to instrument temperature variations during the mission.                  
     Several 'housekeeping' measurements documenting the instrument status are
included in the design. These are a contamination monitor, an alignment       
monitor, output monitors of the sources, three temperature monitors, and one  
voltage monitor. The contamination/alignment monitor uses a low power         
light-emitting-diode (LED) source (Texas Instrument, Inc. Model TIES 35)      
located in the back-scatter unit to produce a reference light beam. This beam 
is reflected by a flat mirror on the axicon assembly onto the                 
contamination/alignment detector, a quadrature detector (E. G. and G.         
Electrooptics Division Model SGD 444-4), in the back-scatter unit. Any        
contamination on the mirror and on the window in front of the detector will   
reduce the total signal produced by summing the signals from the four segments
of the detector, indicating contamination in the scattering channels.         
Alignment changes are manifested by motion of the reference beam on the four  
segments of the detector, changing the magnitude of the signals measured by   
each segment.                                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.3. ELECTRONIC DESIGN                                                        
                                                                              
     The Nephelometer electronic system acquires and processes all of the data
from the forward- and backward-scatter channels and, also, from the           
'housekeeping' sensors, formatting these data for transmission to the Probe   
telemetry system. It provides the drives for the laser injection diode (LID)  
and light emitting diode (LED) light sources, appropriate timing signals, and 
conditions the power received from the spacecraft 28-VDC power bus to provide 
regulated supplies to the instrument. An overall block diagram of the analog  
circuitry is shown in Figure 4 and a very simplified block diagram of the     
digital signal processing is shown in Figure 5.                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.3.1. Scatter Data Collection and Processing Considerations                  
                                                                              
     The predicted Probe descent trajectory and range of ambient cloud        
parameters give rise to requirements that lead to a fairly complex data       
collection and processing system. The acceptable dynamic range of the         
measurements is to exceed 10^5. Scatter measurements are to be made at least  
once during each kilometer of Probe descent even though the descent velocity  
of the Probe varies greatly during descent. Because of the limitation on data 
transmission rate allocated to the Nephelometer, this means that the data     
collection rate exceeds the data transmission rate during the early part of   
the mission.                                                                  
     These considerations, as well as good design practice to maximize        
signal-to-noise ratios, lead to the following data collection and reduction   
scheme.                                                                       
     The LIDs are continuously pulsed at 2000 pps with the forward-scatter LID
pulse leading the backscatter LID pulse by 250 micro seconds. The data        
sampling sequence is controlled by the digital timing circuits. During a      
sampling period a measurement involves the detection, amplification,          
digitization, and digital integration of the detected scatter

signals in each scatter channel from 64 bursts, each burst consisting of 64   
light pulses emitted at equal time intervals. The scatter channel detectors   
produce signals for each light pulse. However, for each burst of 64 pulses,   
only 1, 8, or 64 of the signals are digitally integrated, as controlled by the
digital circuitry from a test of the output of the A/D converter. This scheme 
provides a digital gain change factor of 64. An additional gain change factor 
of 8 is provided by adjusting the gain of an analog amplifier in the signal   
processing circuitry for each scatter channel. The dynamic range of > 10^5 is 
achieved by using an 8-bit A/D converter along with the combined digital and  
analog gain change factors. The A/D converter used here allows for some       
possible negative baseline drift in the most sensitive ranges of each channel.
The interval between the samples is varied so that at the beginning of the    
descent, data from 64 bursts are collected every 3 s (corresponding to        
predictions of less than 1 km of descent) for each of the scatter channels and
this 3-s sampling period is repeated 10 times. The interval is then increased 
to 4 s for the next 10 records, then to 5 s for 10 records, etc., until the   
interval is 12 s for 10 records. At this time, 750 s after the start of data  
acquisition, the interval is reduced to a constant 8 s so that the data       
acquisition rate and data transmission rate are equal for the rest of the     
mission.                                                                      
     A Nephelometer data frame consists of the synchronization word,          
engineering data, and data from 10 scattering data records for a total of 800 
bits. The data transmission rate to the spacecraft telemetry system is 128    
bps, of which 10 bps is allocated to the Nephelometer. Since initially at     
deployment the data for the first sample are collected at 26.7 bps            
(corresponding to an 800 bit frame in 30 s), a buffer memory is provided in   
the form of a digital, first-in-first-out (FIFO), random-access-memory (RAM). 
The data stored in this FIFO RAM are transferred to it from an integrating    
RAM configuration in the form of a compressed 10-bit word using a sign bit, 3 
bits for a power of 2 exponent, and 6 bits for the 6 active most significant  
bits (MSBS) in the 24-bit register of the integrating RAM.                    
     The gain changing technique involves monitoring the A/D converter output 
word for each scatter channel conversion. If the four most significant bits   
(MSBS) of the word are all ones the channel gain is decreased by a factor of  
eight. If the 4 MSBs are all zeros, the gain is increased by a factor of 8.   
The digital gain at which the data are collected is taken into account in the 
integrating RAM by the proper shifting of the new data from the A/D converter 
output before it is added to the register contents. The gain (512, 64, 8, or  
1) of the 16 degree forward scatter channel is also reported in the output    
data stream four times during each measurement interval, as a rough measure of
the variability of the scatter signal (or cloud variability).                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.3.2. Analog Electronics                                                     
                                                                              
     An overall block diagram for the analog circuitry is given in Figure 4.  
The high power LID light sources, driven by a train of 9 A, 200 ns pulses at  
2000 pps from an SCR-controlled capacitor discharge, illuminate the scattering
volume. The cloud-scattered light for each of the four forward and single     
backward-scatter channels is sensed by silicon p-i-n diodes operated in the   
photoconductive mode. Each photodiode signal is ac-coupled to its charge      
sensitive preamplifier to prevent the high background illumination signal from
saturating the channel. The preamplifier, identical in each channel except for
gain, is a wide bandwidth, low noise configuration with a very high dynamic   
range and slew rate. The output of each preamplifier is then fed to an active 
bandpass filter to optimize the signal to noise ratio and provide some gain   
before being multiplexed and sent from the sensor head to the electronics     
unit. An 8:1 gain change amplifier and a balanced integrate and hold circuit  
complete the analog processing of the signal prior to A/D conversion.         
Considerable care was taken in the design of all of these elements because of 
the low level, high-speed processing required, the constraints on power and   
size, and the need to survive and function properly in the high-energy        
radiation environment.                                                        
     The alignment/contamination LED is driven by a train of 300 micro second 
pulses at 1000 pps. The LED light reflected from the flat mirror mounted on   
the axicon base is detected by a quad photodiode each of whose diodes is      
operated in the photoconductive mode. The output signal from each section of  
the detector is amplified by a transimpedance amplifier and multiplexed to the
A/D converter. For each fifth light pulse from the LED the four amplified     
photodiode signals are added in a summing amplifier, and the result           
multiplexed to the A/D converter.                                             
     The A/D converter is an 8-bit, bipolar. dual slope, integrating type with
auto-zeroing. It contains integrated circuit operational amplifiers and       
comparators and CMOS central logic operating with a 2 MHz clock.              
     Source light output monitors for the LIDs are provided. Each monitor     
consists of a silicon p-i-n diode (E. G. and G. Electro-optics Division Model 
SGD 040B) operated in the photovoltaic mode, and is illuminated by a portion  
of its LID's light output. A charge sensitive preamplifier and a sample and   
hold circuit process the sampled signal from one light pulse for A/D          
conversion and inclusion in the output instrument condition data. A           
photodiode/preamplifier combination unit is used to monitor the output of the 
LED, and its output signal is also multiplexed to the A/D converter.          
     The 5.5-V reference and signals from three temperature sensors, one near 
each of the LIDs in the sensor head and one near the A/D converter in the     
electronics unit, are separately multiplexed in one of the four special       
multiplexers used for instrument condition signals, then amplified and        
multiplexed to the A/D converter.                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.3.3. Digital electronics                                                    
                                                                              
     A simplified block diagram of the digital electronics is shown in Figure 
5. The Nephelometer digital electronics provides all system timing, A/D       
converter control, data formatting and integration, and telemetry interface   
control. No microprocessor is used. Nephelometer operation requires three     
sequential operational modes, the gathering of scatter data 64 times and      
transfer to integrating memory, transfer of scatter data integrations into    
another memory awaiting transmission to telemetry, and preparation of preface 
information, comprising a sync word, frame count, and instrument status data. 
The oscillator-clock generator generates all of the system timing signals     
required for all of the subsystems, such as the power supply, and, especially,
for commanding the system into one of the three modes of operation. The       
sequencer logic provides the LID and LED firing pulses, the integrate, sample,
and reset commands, and commands to transfer data to the spacecraft telemetry 
system. The integrating RAM section performs the digital integration on 64    
analog data measurements and provides signals to the analog gain changing     
circuitry. Transfer circuitry compresses the data in the integrating RAM and  
transfers it to the FIFO RAM for storage. During the preface mode of operation
the frame and sync word generator and digitized instrument status data are    
transferred into the FIFO RAM storage.                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.4. MECHANICAL DESIGN                                                        
                                                                              
     The Nephelometer instrument consists of three separate physical units,   
the forward scatter sensor unit on which the deployment mechanism is mounted, 
the backward scatter sensor unit, and the electronics enclosure. Figure 3 is a
cutaway view of the Nephelometer with key components labeled. The two sensor  
units, vented to the ambient atmosphere to eliminate optical distortion or    
mechanical fracture, are fastened to each other and mounted to the Probe      
equipment mounting plate. The combined sensor units are slightly tilted on the
mounting plate to allow for clearance with other equipment. Shims are used to 
align the optical systems except for a lateral adjustment of the laser diode  
sources. The electronics enclosure is sealed with one Earth atmosphere inside.
A pressure sensor inside the sealed unit was used in laboratory tests in      
vacuum and under pressure to verify, within the test experimental limits, the 
integrity of the seal both for the long cruise phase and entry to at least the
20 bar level. The electronic boards inside are mounted in a manner to minimize
the effects of being subjected to the 400 g entry deceleration pulse, as well 
as launch vibration. For example, the relatively heavy power supply is mounted
near the bottom of the enclosure.                                             
     The deployment mechanism consists of a folded, hinged, spring-loaded arm 
on which the axicon mirror assembly is mounted, and a positive latching       
mechanism. The arm is folded through launch, cruise, and initial entry, and   
retained in position by a pin mounted in a pyrotechnically-initiated pin      
puller. At a pressure of approximately 0.07 bar the aeroshell is jettisoned,  
the pin puller fired, and the axicon assembly deployed under the action of a  
helical spring. The inboard section of the arm is a perforated rectangular    
tube and the outboard section a perforated channel to which the axicon        
assembly is mounted. The arm is downstream and off to the side of the         
centerline of the axicon assembly, to reduce possible flow field interference 
with the measurements, and is perforated to mitigate aerodynamic lift effects 
(that might affect Probe rotation) and sympathetic vibrations due to von      
Karman vortex shedding. The end cap of the axicon assembly is convex and is   
vented to produce a pressure differential, helping to prevent particle        
condensation on mirror surfaces. The positive latching mechanism consists of  
the deployment spring, a counter-action leaf spring, and two overlapping      
spring plates, the ends of which are wedge-shaped and pass over each other,   
latching on the back ends of the wedges. The leaf spring forces the contact   
between these surfaces. The spring constants are chosen to assure deployment  
even at a zero Probe rotation rate, to absorb enough energy in latching to    
prevent arm distortion due to deformation during deployment at a possible 80  
RPM Probe rotation rate, and to force close contact between the backs of the  
wedges. Materials are selected to minimize distortion by differential thermal 
expansion. Calculations, using a Monte-Carlo program, have indicated that, for
the worst case (involving offsets in pitch angle creating opposite sensitivity
shifts in the 5.8 and 16.0 degree channels), alignment offsets of less        
than 0.06 degrees will produce sensitivity shifts of less than one            
digitization step. Acceptable performance has been verified from tests that   
have demonstrated alignment reproducibility to less than 0.05 degrees on      
repeated deployment, and misalignment of less than 0.05 degrees due to liquid 
nitrogen induced thermal shock.                                               
     Calculations of the predicted thermal behavior (temperatures, thermal    
contraction/expansion, stresses) of the Nephelometer during the course of the 
Probe descent in the Jovian atmosphere have been performed using the MITA     
(Martin Integrated Thermal Analysis) program alone with a 118 node thermal    
model of the instrument. Input quantities are derived from sample entry       
trajectories, atmospheric structure models, transport and thermodynamic       
properties of the atmospheric gases, internal Probe temperatures and initial  
conditions, and free heat transfer coefficients. The results of these         
calculations for the final design of the Nephelometer are such that no serious
thermal effects on instrument performance are predicted to occur during the   
course of the Probe mission.                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
                    4. Calibration, Tests, and Performance                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
4.1. GENERAL                                                                  
                                                                              
     In order to derive particle sizes, number densities and other properties.
the measured relative magnitudes of the signals in each channel with respect  
to the other channels are compared for best fit with those obtained from      
Mie-scattering calculations. Model particle size distributions (normalized to 
one particle per cm^3) are used, with mean size and distribution width as     
parameters. Particle indices of refraction must, in general, be assumed or    
inferred from other sources for these calculations, although the calculated   
results are not strongly sensitive to the choice of index, especially in the  
forward direction. Conversely, if the particles are assumed to be only weakly 
absorbing and roughly spherical, the measured data, especially from the       
backward scatter channel, will provide constraints on allowable indices. Also,
if the particles are not strongly absorbing, deviation of the measured        
scattering at wide angles from that calculated for spherical particle         
distributions is a strong hint that the particles may not be spherical. The   
calculated differential scattering cross section for each channel for the     
particle size distribution with these best fit parameters is then compared    
with the absolute value measured in each channel n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta,      
yielding the particle number density, n. Inference of opacities and mass      
densities follows directly from the calculated total cross sections and       
reasonable assumptions about particle mass density.                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
4.2. CALIBRATION                                                              
                                                                              
     Two methods were used to calibrate the Nephelometer. The first is similar
to the method described by Pritchard and Elliott (1960), as modified for      
application to the present case. This technique involves recording the        
response of each of the scattering channels to the scattered light produced by
a diffusely scattering target positioned perpendicular to the source beam     
optical axis, as the target is stepped along the source beam until the        
sensitive volume for each channel has been traversed. For the                 
forward-scattering channels a carefully documented diffusely transmitting     
screen mounted into the end of a set of telescoping tubes is used. The        
transmitting screen transmittance is carefully measured using a standard      
integrating sphere and the screen's angular response and polarization         
characteristics are documented with a specially constructed goniometer.       
Similar procedures are used to verify the characteristics of a large specially
constructed Lambertian reflector that was used to calibrate the backward      
scattering channel. Calibrated neutral density attenuating filters are used in
front of the collecting optics for the detectors in each channel to maintain  
the signals within the dynamic range of the instrument. The manner of relating
the readings obtained using this scanning method to the calibration constants 
to be used in measuring actual aerosols is described below.                   
     The Nephelometer instrument produces counts, C, in proportion to the     
product of particle differential scattering cross section, at angle theta,    
[dsigma/dOmega]_theta (with units of m^2 sr^-1), and particle number density, 
n (with units of m^-3) with combined units for this product,                  
n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta of m^-1 sr^-1. The proportionality constant is the     
product of source intensity I_s, effective sampling volume V_eff, and         
detector/electronics/optics gain constant K. The instrument count output C can
be written as follows:                                                        
                                                                              
     C = (KI_sV_eff)n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta = (1/E)n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta      
                                                                              
and, the desired measured value,                                              
                                                                              
     n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta = CE = C/(KI_sV_eff) .                            
                                                                              
In response to a diffuse calibration target normal to the source beam at      
position x, filling an effective area A_eff(x), and having reflectivity (or   
transmission) at angle of T cos theta, the instrument count output will be    
given by                                                                      
                                                                              
     C(x) = t(x) = [KI_sA_eff(x)] (T cos theta)/pi .                          
                                                                              
     Because the normal calibration target is so bright, it is necessary to   
reduce the amount of scattered radiation reaching the detector with an        
attenuator of attenuation factor F. By moving this calibration target along   
the beam over all x at which response is obtained, and integrating the        
response over all x, we obtain                                                
                                                                              
integral [C(x) dx] =                                                          
                                                                              
integral [t(x) dx] =                                                          
                                                                              
K(I_s/piF)(T cos theta) integral [A_eff(x) dx] =                              
                                                                              
K(I_s/piF)(T cos theta)V_eff    .                                             
                                                                              
Thus, the proportionality constant E, in units of m^-1 sr^-1 count^-1, can    
then be evaluated from                                                        
                                                                              
E = (KI_sV_eff)^-1 =                                                          
                                                                              
T cos theta{(piF)(integral[t(x) dx])}^-1  .                                   
                                                                              
     In practice it is also necessary to make small corrections to account for
the deviation of the reflection or transmission screens from true diffuse     
behavior, and polarization characteristics of the sources, screens, and       
detection system. The accuracy of this calibration procedure is a function of 
the accuracy of our knowledge of the reflection (or transmission) of the      
screen used to calibrate the Nephelometer and its simulation of diffuse       
reflection (or transmission), the accuracy of the measurement of the          
attenuation factor of the attenuator, the accuracy of the data taken at each  
target position, and the accuracy of the integration yielding the calibration 
factor. Estimates of the overall accuracy range from less than +- 5 percent   
for the 5, 15, and 180 degree channels to less than +- 10 percent for the 40  
and 70 degree channels.                                                       
     The second type of calibration method involves obtaining the response of 
the instrument to a well-documented 'standard' aerosol environment. These     
tests were performed in a large test chamber at Particle Measuring Systems,   
Inc. (PMS) of Boulder, Colorado. An aerosol with a very narrowly dispersed    
size distribution was produced by atomizing a suspension of spherical         
polystyrene or polyvinyl toluene particles into a large spherical chamber. The
particle sizes were measured using standard electron microscope sizing        
techniques developed for aerosol research at Ames Research Center. The density
of particles and the proportion of single particles to 'doublets','triplets', 
etc., in the actual aerosol was documented using standard particle sizing     
instrumentation manufactured and calibrated by PMS. Nephelometer responses    
were recorded for a variety of particle sizes, particle densities and particle
composition. The calibration for each of the scatter channels was then        
determined, using Mie-scattering cross sections calculated for the            
PMS-documented aerosol distributions.  In general, the results obtained were  
within 30 to 50 percent (often within 10 percent) of those measured using the 
first method. However, the variations in the results of repeated experiments  
in the particle chamber indicated that the results were less reliable than    
those of the target scanning technique. Closer investigation indicated a      
number of variables in the test conditions that were apparently difficult to  
control. For example, small persistent air currents in the test chamber were  
present, produced during aerosol injection, by thermal gradients, by the      
sampling of the PMS instrumentation, or by other causes. These currents       
introduced inhomogeneities and differences in the particle densities as       
measured by the test instrumentation and the Nephelometer. In addition, it    
proved to be difficult to produce an aerosol with a low enough content of     
aggregate particles, such that these larger particles did not appreciably     
affect the measured scattering cross sections. It was suspected that some of  
the particles might also have been electrically charged and that electrical   
effects, for example, at the chamber walls, may have produced differences     
between the aerosol sampled by the PMS instruments and the Nephelometer.      
                                                                              
                                                                              
4.3. Tests                                                                    
                                                                              
A number of tests have been performed to characterize and validate the        
performance of the Nephelometer. Environmental tests have included vibration  
and acceleration tests, steady state and transient thermal tests, and vacuum  
and pressure tests (of the electronics unit). Particle flow experiments in a  
wind tunnel were performed on a simulated Probe configuration to validate     
theoretical particle flow calculations and the effectiveness of the design of 
the deployed arm in obviating distortions in the particle size distribution   
functions in the sample volumes (Ragent and Snyder, 1992). The arm-deployment 
mechanism was tested for its ability to repeatedly deploy the arm and mirror  
assembly accurately. Tests of the effects of possible thermal distortion or   
thermal shock on the scattering angle during deployment were also performed.  
                                                                              
                                                                              
4.4 Performance                                                               
                                                                              
     Instrument characteristics are summarized in Table I. The calibration    
constants obtained at a fixed instrument temperature of approximately 293 K   
for each of the five scatter channels are listed. As mentioned above, the     
absolute uncertainty of the calibration for each channel is estimated to be   
less than 10 percent. For actual measurements in the Jovian atmosphere we must
include errors arising from possible telemetry effects, granulation           
uncertainties in the data extending from about + 1.7 percent to + 6.7 percent 
inherent in the data compression scheme used here, variations in the measured 
values due to noise in each channel, and particle sampling statistical        
fluctuations, which will be small for all reasonable signals (cf. Ragent and  
Blamont, 1980).                                                               
     Multiplying the calibration constants by the adjusted number of counts   
attributable to scattering from particles in the channel sample volume yields 
the desired measured quantity n[dsigma/dOmega]_theta for each channel. The    
adjusted value is obtained by correcting the raw counts for temperature       
dependences of channel sensitivity and baseline values in each channel. Curves
of these temperature corrections were obtained in the test programs mentioned 
above. Although these corrections vary nonlinearly with temperature and differ
for each channel, a rough value of the magnitude of baseline shift with       
temperature is about 50 counts per 10 degrees change from the nominal         
calibration temperature, and about a 10 percent change per 10 degrees for the 
channel sensitivity change. Calculations of the thermal variation of the      
instrument during Probe descent predict that sensitive components will not    
vary by more than 10 percent and that, therefore temperature corrections of   
the adjusted data will be possible to within a few percent.                   
     Noise values in each channel also vary with temperature and are greater  
in the more sensitive channels, the 40, 70, and 180 degree channels. The      
values vary from about +- 5 counts in the 5 degree channel to about +- 30     
counts in the 180 degree channel at about 293 K, and increase by about a      
factor of 1.5 for a temperature increase of 10 degrees above the nominal      
calibration temperature.                                                      
     Our knowledge and uncertainties about the kinds and densities of         
particles we may expect to encounter during Probe descent in the Jovian       
atmosphere were summarized above. Although it is quite likely that we will    
encounter small haze or chromophore particles with sizes of the order of 0.1  
microns, as well as large particles of NH3 ice, H2O ice and liquid, or other  
large particles, the only fairly well identified particles at the present time
are the approximately 1.0 - 2.0 micron size particles (particle densities of  
the order of a few hundred per cm^-3) in the upper cloud. For this Jovian     
cloud, that may be roughly analogous to some optically thin Earth-type light  
clouds (cf., for example, Tables T.60 and T.105 of Deirmendjian, 1969), we may
expect angular scattering cross sections varying from about 10^-2 to 10^-3    
m^-1 sr^-1 at 6 degrees from the forward direction to about 10^-4 to 10^-5    
m^-1 sr^-1 in the backward direction, and a volume extinction coefficient of  
about 3 x 10^-3 m^-1. The instrument can be expected to read at least several 
thousand counts in all channels, except perhaps for the 70 degree channel,    
which would be expected to read somewhat less than 1000 counts. We may thus   
expect to begin to characterize this cloud at particle concentrations greater 
than about 5 to 10 cm^-3, and to detect it at considerably lower              
concentrations.                                                               
    We have attempted to investigate the accuracy of recovery of cloud        
parameters from our measured data be the following procedure. We have         
assumed that our particles can be modeled by spherical particles using two    
parameters to characterize the particle size distribution, r_m, the mean      
particle radius, as weighted by the geometric cross section, and sigma_m, the 
variance of the distribution, again weighted by the geometric cross section.  
We generated 'measured' values (labeled r_m^* and sigma_m^*) by selecting     
values for r_m and sigma_m, and used the Mie-scattering theory to find the    
scattering phase function P(theta_j) for a range of values of r_m and sigma_m.
From these calculated phase functions as a function of r_m and sigma_m, we    
then computed the fractional deviation, FDV, defined as                       
                                                                              
FDV = {N^-1[w_jP*(theta_j) - w_jP(theta_j)]^2}^1/2,                           
                                                                              
where P*(theta_j) is the phase function at angle theta_j corresponding to     
r_m^* and sigma_m^*, N = 4 for the current case, and w_j is a weighting       
function that depends on the accuracy of the measurements. For the case where 
the expected error in the measurement is independent of the value of the      
measured quantity ('constant error'), w_j = (P_max^*)^-1, where P_max^* is the
largest value of P*(theta_j). Alternatively, if the measurement error is      
proportional to the value of the measured quantity ('constant relative        
error'), w_j = [P*(theta_j)]^-1. For our instrument, the errors lie between   
these two cases, but are closer to the latter.                                
     Examination of the results of calculations of the FDV over the ranges of 
the parameters r_m and sigma_m for various assumed forms of the particle size 
distribution function (e.g., log-normal and modified gamma function) and      
particle indices of refraction have indicated that, for the measurement errors
discussed above, it should be possible to obtain useful estimates of the mean 
particle radius within less than a factor of 2 over the entire mean radius    
range of about 0.2 to 20 microns, and to within a factor of less than 1.4 over
the range from about 0.3 to 6.0 microns. The loss of sensitivity for small    
values of r_m is due to the particles becoming Rayleigh scatterers, whereas   
for large r_m the diffraction peak lies entirely at angles smaller than the   
smallest angle of observation. The calculations have also shown that the      
sensitivity of the FDV to changes in sigma_m is low, and consequently, only   
modest bounds may be placed on the width of the particle size distribution.
