     This file provides a list of major references, and the references        
therein, that will aid in the understanding of the probe aerodynamics         
and spin behavior during both the entry and descent phases. This is not       
meant to be a complete list of references on the subject. Some references     
to company documents are incomplete.

This report covers the hypersonic and supersonic aerodynamics of the entry    
module, needed for the extraction of atmospheric properties from measured     
decelerations.

This reports on the final configuration of the Galileo parachute system       
and a parachute drop test on July 25, 1983. This test was of a parachute      
that was not the final configuration.
