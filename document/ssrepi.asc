Abstract. The Energetic Particles Investigation (EPI) instrument operates     
during the pre-entry phase of the Galileo Probe. The major science objective  
is to study the energetic particle population in the innermost regions of the 
Jovian magnetosphere - within 4 radii of the cloud tops - and into the upper  
atmosphere. To achieve these objectives the EPI instrument will make          
omnidirectional measurements of four different particle species - electrons,  
protons, alpha-particles, and heavy ions (Z > 2). Intensity profiles with a   
spatial resolution of about 0.02 Jupiter radii will be recorded. Three        
different energy range channels are allocated to both electrons and protons to
provide a rough estimate of the spectral index of the energy spectra. In      
addition to the omnidirectional measurements, sectored data will be obtained  
for certain energy range electrons, protons, and alpha-particles to determine 
directional anisotropies and particle pitch angle distributions. The detector 
assembly is a two-element telescope using totally depleted, circular silicon  
surface-barrier detectors surrounded by a cylindrical tungsten shielding with 
a wall thickness of 4.86 g cm^-2. The telescope axis is oriented normal to the
spherical surface of the Probe's rear heat shield which is needed for heat    
protection of the scientific payload during the Probe's entry into the Jovian 
atmosphere. The material thickness of the heat shield determines the lower    
energy threshold of the particle species investigated during the Probe's      
pre-entry phase. The EPI instrument is combined with the Lightning and Radio  
Emission Detector (LRD) such that the EPI sensor is connected to the LRD/EPI  
electronic box. In this way, both instruments together only have one interface
of the Probe's power, command, and data unit.                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
1. Introduction                                                               
                                                                              
   The principal scientific objective of the Energetic Particles Investigation
(EPI) is to measure the energetic particle population of the innermost region 
of the Jovian magnetosphere within 5 Jupiter radii (Rj). Both the Pioneer and 
the Voyager missions provided measurements in a portion of this inner         
magnetospheric region (Armstrong et al., 1981; Schardt and Goertz, 1983). The 
most prominent findings include a continuing increase of the particle fluxes  
with decreasing radial distance to the planet down to the closest distance    
measured (~1.6 Rj for Pioneer 11). However, the increase in fluxes is not     
simply monotonic, but rather shows a complex shell-like structure, which      
depends on energy and particle species (Fillius, 1976; Simpson and McKibben,  
1976). These observations have been interpreted as indicating the absorption  
of the radially inward-diffusing particles by macroscopic objects orbiting the
planet. There is also strong indication in the previous measurements for pitch
angle scattering due to wave-particle interactions (Gurnett and Scarf, 1983;  
McDonald and Trainor, 1976; Simpson and McKibben, 1976; Van Allen, 1976).     
Closer to the planet than previous missions have gone (~ 1.6 Rj) other loss   
effects, such as radiation loss in the case of electrons and atmospheric      
absorption, will become more and more dominant. The measurements of EPI will  
be extended as close as possible to the planet's atmosphere (~ 1 Rj) in order 
to complete the knowledge about the energetic particle population at the      
inner edge of the Jovian magnetosphere and to make it possible to study the   
related magnetospheric transport processes. The operational period of the EPI 
is terminated by the beginning of the entry phase when the power supply       
for the sensor head is switched off.                                          
                                                                              
   The Voyager 1 mission detected, by imaging observations, a ring of dust    
particles around Jupiter near 1.8 Rj as well as the small satellites Adrastea 
and Metis at the outer edge of this ring (Jewitt et al., 1979; Owen et al.,   
1979; Smith et al., 1979). The existence of absorbing material in this region 
was already suggested from particle observations made by Pioneer 11 (Schardt  
and Goertz, 1983). Because of the absence of measurements, little is known    
about particle loss, source processes, and fluxes inside the closest approach 
of Pioneer 11. Particle losses due to the existence of Jupiter's ring and the 
satellites mentioned above are likely to be significant and to be dependent   
upon energy and pitch angle. Particle losses analogous to terrestrial         
conditions, such as Coulomb energy degradation in the atmosphere, may or may  
not be important, depending upon the density of free and bound electrons in   
Jupiter's upper ionosphere. A candidate for internal particle sources at low  
altitudes is cosmic-ray produced albedo neutron decay. This especially        
interesting region will be fully covered by EPI measurements.                 
                                                                              
   In summary, electron and ion data acquired by the EPI instrument within    
1.1-2 Rj will be used to:                                                     
-test the validity of radial diffusion as a transport and acceleration        
mechanism in the deep inner magnetosphere;                                    
-infer the nature of field perturbations responsible for radial diffusion;    
-infer the size distribution and radial structure of Jupiter's ring;          
-identify possible additional inner magnetosphere source and loss mechanisms. 
                                                                              
   Moreover, comparisons of Galileo Probe and Pioneer 11 measurements in the  
region ~5 Rj to ~1.6 Rj will provide information on any temporal variations of
inner-zone particle fluxes.                                                   
                                                                              
2. EPI Instrument                                                             
                                                                              
Sensor.  Fundamental to the design of the detector configuration was the      
requirement to maintain expected counting rates below about 3 million counts  
per second under the most intense anticipated flux conditions. Another design 
constraint was the lower threshold for the particle species to be measured.   
This is defined by the material thickness of the Probe's aft heat shield. The 
heat shield consists of different layers of aluminum, silicon adhesive,       
kapton, mylar, dacron, and phenolic nylon. For perpendicularly-penetrating    
particles it has a resulting thickness of 1.34 cm, equivalent to about 1.87 g 
cm^-2 'shielding' (determined from a piece of heat shield material used in the
calibrations; see last section).

and detector and shielding configuration of the EPI sensor head.              
                                                                              
                                                                              
   The detector assembly is a two-element telescope using totally-depleted,   
circular silicon surface barrier detectors. Both detectors have a radius of   
1.4 mm with sensitive areas of 6.2 mm^2 and thicknesses of 0.5 mm. A 3 mm     
thick (equivalent to 2.55 g cm^-2) brass absorber is inserted between the two 
detectors in order to expand the energy range of particles to be investigated.
The total length of the telescope (upper surface front detector to lower      
surface back detector) is 6 mm. The detector assembly is surrounded by        
tungsten shielding with a cylindrical wall thickness of 2.7 mm (equivalent to 
4.86 g cm^-2) The entire Probe and its contents, estimated to be equivalent to
at least 80 g cm^-2, forms the shielding at the rear of the telescope. A      
reduced background rate is thus expected from the rear.                       
                                                                              
   The tungsten shielding cylinder is elongated beyond the front detector     
surface and forms an open aperture cone of length 6.7 mm with an opening      
diameter of 9 mm. The aperture opening angle of 44 degrees and the detector   
area define an effective opening angle of 73 degrees and a geometrical factor 
of 0.045 cm^2 sr, for single particle counting events in the front detector.  
The corresponding values for coincidence events are 44 degrees and 0.01 cm^2  
sr, respectively.                                                             
                                                                              
   The axis of the telescope is mounted at an inclination angle of 41 degrees 
with respect to the Probe's spin axis (Figure 1). The orientation of the      
Probe's spin axis in space and the local magnetic field direction define the  
range in which pitch angle distributions can be determined by the instrument. 
                                                                              
   Telescope and analog electronics, the detector bias supply converter, and  
three housekeeping channels for monitoring leakage currents in the two        
detectors and the ambient temperature are contained in the sensor box (Figure 
2).

data processing, and data formatting are executed with the Lightning and Radio
Emission Detector (LRD) data, in the central electronics box (see Lanzerotti  
et al., 1992). A summary of the energy channels for the different particle    
species is given in Table 1.                                                  
                                                                              
   Electronics. The limits on the available Probe power prohibited the design 
and development of extremely fast circuitry for the EPI. As a compromise      
between the demands of power consumption and high-frequency response, a pulse 
rate of 3 million counts per second can be handled by the EPI analog          
electronics. An overview of the EPI analog electronics is given in Figure 3.

   The detectors must be maintained in operational condition during the ~6    
years cruise phase from Earth to Jupiter. There is no power available from the
Probe's main battery supply, which will only be activated shortly before the  
pre-entry part of the cruise phase. Therefore, in order to supply the         
detectors with bias voltage, a compact battery package with a capacity of     
about 250 mA-h is contained in a special fixture on the front side of the     
electronic box. The battery consists of Li/CrOx cells having an open circuit  
voltage of approximately 3.6 V. The assembly is configured in two stacks with 
ten cells each. The overall voltage output is ~75 V, which has been monitored 
in different test assemblies for more than 4 years. The batteries have been   
carefully tested and selected from an especially fabricated series with       
respect to the operational requirements under vacuum conditions.

   A limited data rate is available for the Energetic Particles Investigation 
during the pre-entry phase. The general mission design approach was to make   
(for comparison purposes) some measurements in regions of the Jovian          
magnetosphere where particle observations from previous missions already exist
and to concentrate the EPI investigation zone, below ~2 Rj. Therefore, the

measurements must be distributed with respect to detected particle species and
with respect to spatial locations in an appropriate manner, in order to obtain
as much information as possible.                                              
                                                                              
   The data coverage of the investigation consists of three data samples made 
near the equatorial region at 5, 4, and 3 Rj, and in a continuous series of   
measurements between 2 and 1.1 Rj.  Limited radio-frequency data will also be 
obtained at these locations by the Lightning and Radio Emission Detector on   
the Probe (see Lanzerotti et al., 1992). During the arrival at Jupiter it will
be of particular advantage for data analysis and interpretation if particle   
measurements are made simultaneously on the Orbiter and on the Probe in the   
region 5 to 4 Rj. The measurements from ~4 Rj down to the innermost edge of   
the trapping region will be continued by the Probe instrument.                
                                                                              
   The distribution of the EPI samples, the related position of the Orbiter,  
and the trajectories of both spacecraft at Jupiter arrival are presented in   
Figure 4. The instrument will make omnidirectional measurements of the        
particle species                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 4.  Orbiter and probe trajectories at Jupiter arrival, showing locations 
of the EPI data acquisition and corresponding locations of the Orbiter and its
science instruments.                                                          
                                                                              
                                                                              
listed in Table 1.  Time-intensity profiles of these species, with a spatial  
resolution of about 0.02 Rj during the period of continuous measurement       
between 2 Rj and 1 Rj, will be recorded. Three different energy range channels
are allocated to both electrons and protons to provide a rough estimate of the
spectral index of the energy of each species in the energy measured.          
                                                                              
   In addition to the omnidirectional measurements, angular sectored data will
be obtained for electrons, protons, and alpha particles in certain energy     
ranges in order to determine directional anisotropies and particle pitch angle
distributions.

Because of the expected low statistics, the heavy particle measurements are   
accumulated over longer time periods. The LRD-determined main magnetic field  
direction will be used for these sectored measurements (see Lanzerotti et al.,
1992).

4.Tests and Calibrations                                                      
                                                                              
   There has been a long series of detector calibration measurements with     
radioactive sources over a period of 10 years to determine the long-term      
stability of the detectors under normal and thermal-vacuum conditions. For the
higher energies, the instrument was calibrated with protons at the Harvard    
Cyclotron (30-150 MeV), with electrons at the Lawrence Livermore accelerator  
(20-30 MeV), and for heavier particles (He, O, Si, Ar) at the Berkeley        
Bevatron (70-340 MeV nucl^-1). The calibration measurements were performed in 
part with a layer of original heat shield material in front of the aperture in
order to determine the influence of the absorber on the instrument's response 
functions.                                                                    
                                                                              
   Subsequent to the calibration measurements, a model of the detector        
assembly was developed for the investigation of more physical details by means
of a Monte-Carlo simulation method (Hoop, 1989; Pehlke, 1988). In a first     
attempt, the calibration measurements without the heat shield were simulated  
in order to compare the experimental and calculated data.  By this procedure  
the influence of the detector edges on the counting efficiency could be       
determined. This is of special importance in case of such tiny detectors      
having a sensitive area diameter as small as 2.8 mm (which has to be          
considered in comparison to the diameter of the original silicon disc (7.2 mm)
mounted in the detector housing). In the case of an ideal detector, the       
efficiency for particle detection should steeply drop from 100% to zero at the
edges of the active area.                                                     
                                                                              
  A model of the real efficiency decrease in the edge regions of the detectors
is presented in Figure 5. This model was a necessary assumption in order to   
explain in detail the distribution of the energy losses of particles which    
were obtained from the accelerator measurements. Figure 6 shows the energy    
dependence of the count rates in selected EPI energy channels (cf. Table I)   
resulting from calibration measurements, and simulation calculations performed
without the heat shield and for protons only. Protons in the energy range     
below 30 MeV could not be provided by the accelerator. In this range, data    
were only obtained by means of simulation. A comparison of the calibration and
simulation data yields a reasonable correspondence. Therefore, further        
simulations incorporating the heat shield were done. Figure 7 shows a         
comparison between the 20 MeV electron calibration results and the simulation 
data, both with the heat shield. In the lower part of this figure the response
of the EPI counting channels is added.                                        
                                                                              
The final aim of the simulation method is to determine a response function of 
the instrument operating behind the heat shield in a particle population with 
a spectral and spatial distribution as might be expected in the innermost part
of the Jovian radiation belt. These simulation capabilities, together with the
calibrations, will be invaluable for interpreting the data to be acquired in  
the harsh inner Jovian magnetosphere.
