Abstract. The Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer (GPMS) is a Probe instrument    
designed to measure the chemical and isotopic composition including vertical  
variations of the constituents in the atmosphere of Jupiter. The measurement  
will be performed by in situ sampling of the ambient atmosphere in the        
pressure range from approximately 150 mbar to 20 bar. In addition batch       
sampling will be performed for noble gas composition measurement and isotopic 
ratio determination and for sensitivity enhancement of non-reactive trace     
gases.                                                                        
     The instrument consists of a gas sampling system which is connected to a 
quadrupole mass analyzer for molecular weight analysis. In addition two sample
enrichment cells and one noble gas analysis cell are part of the sampling     
system. The mass range of the quadrupole analyzer is from 2 amu to 150 amu.   
The maximum dynamic range is 10^8. The detector threshold ranges from 10 ppmv 
for H2O to 1 ppbv for Kr and Xe. It is dependent on instrument background and 
ambient gas composition because of spectral interference. The threshold values
are lowered through sample enrichment by a factor of 100 to 500 for stable    
hydrocarbons and by a factor of 10 for noble gases. The gas sampling system   
and the mass analyzer are sealed and evacuated until the measurement sequence 
is initiated after the Probe enters into the atmosphere of Jupiter. The       
instrument weighs 13.2 kg and the average power consumption is 13 W.          
     The instrument follows a sampling sequence of 8192 steps and a sampling  
rate of two steps per second. The measurement period lasts appropriately 60   
min through the nominal pressure and altitude range.

1.1. INTRODUCTION                                                             
                                                                              
     The Voyager observations, complemented by ground-based measurements, have
contributed immensely to our knowledge of the atmosphere of Jupiter. Despite  
this success however, the inventory of known constituents in the atmosphere is
severely limited. The gross computation still includes large statistical      
uncertainties in the mixing ratios of various species, and the noble gas      
abundances (with the exception of helium) are completely unknown. Isotopic    
ratios, which might harbor the secret of the origin, and to some extent,      
evolution of the atmosphere of Jupiter, are hardly measured at all -- the only
exceptions being certain isotopes of carbon and hydrogen.                     
     It is already apparent from a few isolated measurements that the         
atmosphere does not fully mimic the solar ratios of the elements. For example,
C/H, O/H, and N/H (from CH4, H2O, and NH3 measurements, respectively) all     
appear to be enhanced relative to solar by factors of 2-3, whereas He/H and   
Ge/H apparently have sub-solar values (Noll et al., 1988; Gautier and Owen,   
1989; Carlson et al., 1991). Both NH3 and H2O condense and form clouds in the 
region of the atmosphere probed by Earth-based observations, so their absolute
abundances are model-dependent. The situation becomes still worse for sulfur, 
which must be present but has not yet been detected. presumably because of its
incorporation into NH4SH clouds (Weidenschilling and Lewis, 1973; Larson et   
al., 1984; Atreya and Romain, 1985). The current upper limit is 10^-3 of the  
solar value.                                                                  
     Altitude-dependent mixing ratios are also exhibited by the disequilibrium
species: those formed through photolysis and charged particle bombardment of  
various constituents in the upper atmosphere, others that are created by      
lightning discharges within the clouds, and a third set consisting of         
molecules formed under thermoequilibrium conditions at the high temperatures  
existing at great depths in the atmosphere, some of which are brought up to   
altitudes where we can observe them by strong vertical convection.            
     With in situ measurements, the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer (GPMS) is 
in a position to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the composition of the     
atmosphere of Jupiter. Furthermore, sample enrichment provides an opportunity 
to address fundamental questions of the origin and evolution of the Jovian    
atmosphere by allowing measurements of trace gases and removing interference  
(by overlapping ions) from key isotopes. Repeated sampling of the atmosphere  
at different altitudes will permit the determination of the altitude          
dependence of constituent abundances, thus enabling correlations with the     
locations of cloud layers and an identification of the source(s) of energy    
driving various chemical reactions.                                           
     The primary objective of the Probe mass spectrometer is thus to determine
abundances and isotope ratios of 'major' (i.e., mole fraction >= 10^-7)       
constituents as a function of altitude. The best precision is obviously       
achieved for the most abundant gases: it is estimated that the mixing ratio   
of He and Ne will be measured to an accuracy of 2 percent and molecules       
difficult to measure with mass spectrometers such as H2O, NH3, and H2S to a   
factor of two or better. To search for trace constituents at concentrations on
the order of 1 ppbv, a sample enrichment system is added to the basic mass    
spectrometer, and for noble gases a purification cell is included. We discuss 
the expected results in the following sections.                               
     The instrument was developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center in       
Greenbelt, Maryland, in collaboration with the University of Michigan Space   
Physics Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich., which developed the          
Electronics Subsystem, and the General Electric Company which developed and   
fabricated the hybrid electronics circults. The Principal Investigator of the 
Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer is H. B. Niemann of NASA-Goddard Space Flight 
Center, and the Co-Investigators are S.K. Atreya, G.R. Carignan. and T. M.    
Donahue of the University of Michigan, R.E. Hartle of NASA-Goddard Space      
Flight Center, D.M. Hunten of the University of Arizona, T.C. Owen of the     
University of Hawaii, and N.W. Spencer of the University of Maryland.         
                                                                              
1.2. SCIENCE GOALS AND GPMS CAPABILITIES                                      
                                                                              
As already mentioned in the Introduction, the mixing ratios of even the       
principal minor constituents in the Jovian atmosphere appear to be non-solar. 
This is consistent with the current paradigm for outer planet formation, which
postulates the initial growth of a core by accretion of icy planetesimals to a
mass of 10-15 M_E, accompanied in its later stages with the gravitational     
attraction of surrounding nebular gases. Thus one anticipates atmospheres     
consisting of a mixture of two components: gases released from the            
planetesimals during accretion and/or through dissolution in the forming      
gaseous envelope, and the gases acquired directly from the solar nebula. This 
should lead to a general enrichment of all heavy elements except neon, which  
is not trapped in ices except at temperatures below 20 K (Bar-Nun et al.,     
1987). In fact, carbon, as manifested in methane, becomes progressively more  
enriched in the series Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, which is also a      
progression in the relative sizes of the planetary cores. This conforms to the
predictions of the model. However, the elements arsenic (as AsH3) and         
phosphorus (as PH3) are more enriched on Saturn (compared to Jupiter) than are
carbon and nitrogen (Noll et al., 1989, 1990). The dichotomy even exists in   
Jupiter itself (Table I). There must be some clues here about the differing   
internal structures of these two bodies, or differences in a way the elements 
were incorporated into the planets. To understand these differences, we need  
to know the abundances of more elements, in order to identify the source of   
the fractionation. For example, does it depend on the ability of a given      
element to form a gas that would be trapped or frozen into ices of an

accreting planetesimal? The abundances of the noble gases could prove to be   
very enlightening as a discriminant between internal and external processes.  
The apparent depletion of helium on Jupiter (Table I) is probably a mild      
example of the much more severe situation on Saturn, where helium is          
dissolving in the metallic hydrogen surrounding the core of the planet. The   
precise values of He/H to come from the HAD experiment on Galileo (von Zahn   
and Hunten, 1992) will allow this interpretation to be sharpened. as will the 
GPMS determinations of other noble gas abundances.                            
     In spite of these deviations from solar abundances, the absence of       
nuclear reactions on Jupiter and the vertical convection in its atmosphere    
suggest that primordial values of isotopic ratios will be preserved, provided 
that we measure them in dominant carriers. Thus we have an opportunity to     
determine the starting value for D/H in the hydrogen gas in the solar nebula. 
The most recent estimate of this cosmologically important ratio from studies  
of 3He/4He in the solar wind and meteorites leads to D/H = 3.4 +- 1 x 10^-5   
(Anders and Grevesse, 1989). Measurements of CH3D/CH4 in Jupiter's atmosphere 
yield D/H = 2 +- 1 x 10^-5 (Gautier and Owen, 1989). Although the error bars  
overlap, there is a suggestion that these values may be higher than the local 
interstellar ratio (D/H = 1.5 +- 1 x 10^-5) and such a difference is          
recognized as a natural consequence of the nuclear burning of deuterium in    
stars, e.g., Geiss and Reeves (1981). A good determination of D/H in the      
primordial solar nebula can thus be used (in principle!) to constrain models  
of Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and galactic evolution, particularly if abundances
of other key elements can be determined in that same reservoir (Gautier and   
Owen, 1983). Jupiter offers us this opportunity, and the GPMS is designed to  
exploit it.                                                                   
     Yet another problem is posed by an observed secular increase of 15N/14N  
in lunar soils (Geiss and Bochsler, 1982; Kerridge, 1989). The two leading    
interpretations of this effect are an as yet undefined nuclear process in the 
convection zone of the Sun (Kerridge, 1989) and the existence of an as yet    
unidentified reservoir of 'light' nitrogen in condensed matter in the solar   
system (Geiss and Bochsler, 1982). Both camps agree that a precise            
determination of 15N/14N on Jupiter would provide an important constraint,    
since it will give the starting value for the nitrogen isotope ratio in the   
solar nebula. This value will also be important as an anchor for the          
interpretation of the 15N/14N enrichment found in the Martian atmosphere      
(Nier and McElroy, 1977).                                                     
     Finally. there has been great interest in disequilibrium chemistry on    
Jupiter. What are the agents responsible for the pastel colors in Jupiter's   
clouds? Why is sulfur so deficient in the regions of the atmosphere that we   
can investigate by remote sensing? What is the relative importance of solar UV
compared with lightning discharges in driving various chemical reactions? Do  
any of these reactions have any relevance to prebiotic chemistry on the       
primitive Earth? All of these questions have been discussed at length in the  
literature, but we have no good answers to any of them. We need more          
information, the kind we can only get by sampling the atmosphere directly,    
repeatedly, over a range of altitudes. This is just what the GPMS will do.    
     For the purposes of illustrating the capabilities of this instrument, we 
use a fictitious 'solar composition' atmosphere as a reference. The following 
tables thus reflect the solar ratios of elements (Anders and Grevesse, 1989)  
and the gases in which they are primarily incorporated in the Jovian          
atmosphere. Where available, these values are compared with actual            
observations. The reader is referred to Chapter 1 of Atreya (1986), Gautier   
and Owen (1989), Noll et al. (1989, 1990). and Carlson et al. (1991), for     
additional discussion.                                                        
                                                                              
1.3. DIRECT INVESTIGATIONS                                                    
                                                                              
     The projected dynamic range of the Probe mass spectrometer is 10^8, hence
in principle, gases with mixing ratios greater than a few tens of ppbv can be 
detected. In practice, the precision of the measurement deteriorates rapidly  
as the limit of instrumental capabilities is approached. Nevertheless, the    
experiment can improve on some of the large uncertainties inherent in remote  
sensing for mixing ratios of most species above 5 x 10^-8.                    
     Inspection of Table I indicates that there are prospects of a rich       
harvest: at the very least eight elemental abundances and eight isotopic      
ratios; nine if sulfur is detected, as it probably will be. Silicon may not be
found even at the deepest level reached by the Probe, but the search is an    
important one (see below). The over-solar abundances of heavy elements (except
neon) predicted by the nucleation-accretion model for giant planet formation  
can be quantitatively evaluated and there is an opportunity to obtain several 
primordial isotope ratios. Important aspects of Jovian chemistry and cloud    
physics will be investigated by recording the abundances of NH3, H2S, and H2O 
at various altitudes. At the present time, the mixing ratios of these         
condensable gases and the locations of the clouds they are expected to produce
(ammonia cirrus, ammonium hydrosulfide, ammonium hydroxide, water) are very   
poorly defined.                                                               
     In particular, the abundance of water in the upper troposphere is so low 
that some authors have suggested it implies a global depletion of oxygen on   
Jupiter (Bjoraker et al., 1986). This conclusion is contradicted by models for
the chemistry of the deep atmosphere that are constrained by observations of  
CO (Noll et al., 1988), requiring near solar abundances of water. Lunine and  
Hunten (1987) have suggested that moist vertical convection on Jupiter is     
limited to narrow plumes, resulting in the very low relative humidity         
observed in the upper atmosphere. The global abundance has been re-assessed by
Carlson et al. (1991), in the most comprehensive model of the Voyager IRIS    
observations to date. These authors find the H2O abundance on Jupiter to be at
least 1.5 times the solar value with a factor of two enrichment providing the 
best fit to the observations. The Carlson et al. model has an NH4SH cloud     
layer at 1.9 bar and the H2O cloud base is at 2.3 bar. This location for the  
ammonium hydrosulfide cloud agrees well with the model developed by Larson et 
al. (1984) and Atreya and Romain (1985) to explain their low upper limit on   
H2S (Table I). We have adopted the Carlson et al. best-fit value for the H2O  
mixing ratio in Table I, although it is strongly model dependent. The         
measurements with the GPMS down to at least 10 bar will reveal the sulfur and 
oxygen mixing ratios by direct measurement for the first time. With careful   
interpretation, it may be possible to explore the role played by sulfur (if it
has one!) in generating observable chromophores in the Jovian clouds.

With a dynamic range of 10^8, it may just be possible to reach krypton and    
xenon. This will depend on the abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere. It should  
be recognized that cosmic abundances of these important constituents are      
poorly determined, since they have never all been measured in a single,       
undisturbed reservoir.  Jupiter offers the first opportunity to do this,      
although the analysis will have to include possible solubility effects in the 
interior of Jupiter and the differences in the ways these gases can be        
incorporated in the ices of planetesimals (Lunine and Stevenson, 1985; Bar-Nun
et al., 1987). The scaling to hydrogen will come from the unpurified sample   
where mixing ratios of He, Ne, and Ar to H2 will be measured directly.        
     Removal of hydrogen increases the relative abundances of all species by  
approximately a factor of 10.  Thus the isotopic ratios of the constituents   
discussed in the previous section can be measured with greater precision in   
this mode.  Removal of hydrogen will greatly diminish interference with the   
3He/4He determination, which is of fundamental importance in comparing the    
deduction of D/H in the primordial solar nebula from meteoritic helium        
measurements with the direct measurement that will be made by the GPMS.

detectable. With a potential enrichment for some of these species by a factor 
100 to 500, several of them may in fact be brought into the measurable range. 
Abundance determinations will then depend on measurements relative to species 
that can be detected directly (without enrichment) as calibrated by the       
laboratory model of the instrument.

    The abundances of the gases produced photochemically in the planet's upper
atmosphere that will be measured by the GPMS are difficult to evaluate from   
present information for two reasons: (a) both the analysis of observations and
theoretical calculations are strongly dependent on model atmospheres and (b)  
the amounts of these gases actually sampled by the Probe mass spectrometer    
will be a strong function of altitude. The figures given are attempts to      
define maximum values: the actual amounts may be lower.                       
     The discovery of lightning on Jupiter by the Voyager spacecraft has      
emphasized the possibility of the production of non-equilibrium species in the
Jovian troposphere. This means that one should search for examples of the     
compounds that have been produced in laboratory experiments simulating an     
electric discharge in a Jovian mixture of gases. Of particular interest are   
HCN, C2H2, CH3CN and a variety of organic compounds including some containing 
sulfur.                                                                       
  At the base of the proposed Probe trajectory, at a pressure of 15-20 bar,   
there is a possibility that trace compounds will be sampled that are only at  
equilibrium at much lower, hotter levels of the atmosphere. Traces of these   
constituents might survive to the deepest level where sampling is possible in 
much the same way CO, GeH4, PH3, and AsH3 are brought to still higher levels  
of the atmosphere where they have been observed spectroscopically. An obvious 
and important candidate in this category is silane - SiH4 - whose enriched    
solar abundance mixing ratio of ~10^-4 should only be reached at temperatures 
above 1200 K.                                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
2. Instrument Description                                                     
                                                                              
2.1. INTRODUCTION                                                             
                                                                              
     Within the constraints of volume, power, and bit rate, a number of       
compromises must be made in the design of an atmospheric composition          
experiment. An important advantage of a mass spectrometer is its impartiality:
within its mass and sensitivity range it detects everything admitted to it,   
and it is therefore ideal for an exploratory mission like the Galileo Probe.  
The instrument chosen is a quadrupole mass spectrometer supplemented by rather
complex 'plumbing' with sample inlets and gas-handling, pressure-reducing, and
pumping systems. To enhance the range of measurements the basic sample inlet  
is supplemented by three selective subsystems: a noble-gas purification cell  
and two sample enrichment cells for the more complex compounds. Advantage is  
taken of non-evaporable chemical getter technology for pumping hydrogen and   
the reactive minor constituents and thus avoid the increased complexity and   
reliability risk associated with moving parts in mechanical pumps such as     
turbomolecular pumps.                                                         
     The approach to the electronics support system is also straightforward   
and conventional. Extensive use was made of hybrid circuit packaging because  
of weight and size limitation. The complexity of microprocessor control is not
desirable given the devastating radiation environment that must be traversed  
before entry into the atmosphere of Jupiter. It is also not necessary since   
all control functions can be handled with conventional electronics and the    
measurement sequence followed during descent is stored reliably in read only  
memory. A summary of the instrument specification is given in Table 6.        
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.2 SAMPLE INLET AND ENRICHMENT SYSTEMS                                       
                                                                              
     The inlet system shown schematically in Figure 1 consists of two fully   
self-contained units which operate in time sequence as the Probe descends     
through the atmosphere. Both units contain an ambient atmosphere flow system  
whose gas inlets are placed near the apex of the Probe, and whose exit ports  
are placed at the minimum pressure point inside the Probe. Ambient atmospheric
pressure at the exit is assumed as a worst case condition. The pressure       
difference (approximately 6 mbar) between the stagnation point and the ambient
pressure point causes a flow past the pressure reducing leaks. Inlet and      
outlet ports are sealed by metal-ceramic devices and kept under vacuum prior  
to entry. They will be opened in sequence after entry by redundant pyrotechnic
actuators.                                                                    
     A small fraction of the gas through the high pressure flow system from   
Inlet 1 to Outlet 1 or Inlet 2 to Outlet 2 is conducted through the pressure  
reducing leaks L1 or L2 into the ionization region of the ion source. The     
leaks, which are arrays of glass capillaries (typically seven capillaries per 
leak) with inside diameters ranging from 1.5 micrometers to 6 micrometers     
have conductances chosen so that the pressure in the ion source does          
not exceed 10^-4 mbar. The capillaries were fabricated in a proprietary       
process by the Galileo Electro Optics Corp. of Sturbridge, Massachusetts. The 
materials used for the inlet system plumbing are primarily nickel and inconel.
The surfaces in contact with the sampled gases were passivated by a silinizing
process.

     The sample enrichment systems are an integral part of the ambient        
atmosphere flow systems. Atmospheric gas, after passing by the capillary leaks
L1 or L2, will be conducted via valve V1 or V6 to the enrichment cells which  
contain getters G1 through G4 that, when activated, chemically bind reactive  
gases during the measurement sequence and thus allow a pure noble gas         
analysis. The enrichment cells C1 and C2 are packed with adsorbing compounds  
chosen to adsorb complex hydrocarbons. The material found through testing to  
be most suitable for this experiment is CARBOSIEVE. 80-100 mesh, a porous     
carbon structure of fixed pore size used commercially as a stationary phase in
packed gas chromatographic columns (available from Supelco, Inc.              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 1. Schematic of the gas inlet system and connection to the mass          
spectrometer sensor. Two parallel gas inlet/outlet systems are employed to    
provide gas samples to the direct leaks, L1 and L2, and to the two sample     
enrichment systems centered around C1 and C2.                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
in Bellefonte, PA). Gases adsorbed by the enrichment cells will be released by
a programmed heating cycle during the Probe descent. During these cycles the  
cells are isolated from the flow system and the getters by valves V1 through  
V9. The valves are solenoid operated microvalves manufactured by Aker         
Industries (formerly Energy Research & Generation, Inc.) of Oakland,          
California. At specified times the gas trapped in the cells is conducted      
through separate capillary leaks L3 and L4 to the ionization region. The      
enrichment factor depends on the chemical and physical properties of the      
sample gas. In general it increases with the molecular weight of the species. 
This is qualitatively illustrated in Figure 2 where mass spectra obtained with
analog laboratory recorders are shown for noble gases and hydrocarbon gas     
mixtures before and after enrichment. The substantial xenon enrichment further
improves the concentration measurement of xenon since the expected mixing     
ratio is marginally measurable by direct analysis.                            
     After use the sample enrichment leaks L3 and L4 and the first direct leak
L1 will be isolated from the ion source by solenoid operated valves V10, V11, 
and V12 to prevent the ion source pressure from exceeding its optimum value,  
and also to permit repeated observation of system background pressure after   
the initial sampling and enrichment sequences are completed. The second       
independent inlet system will be opened to the atmosphere after the first     
system has been isolated from the ion source.

distortion caused by gas-surface interactions is minimized by directing the   
high pressure flow against the capillary leak and by locating the leaks in the
ion source so that the gas leaves the capillaries on the ion source side      
directly through the ionizing electron beam. The gas emitted from the         
capillaries can thus be ionized and analyzed without having experienced       
previous surface collisions with the ion source walls. Limits of the pumping  
speeds imposed by weight and power constraints in a flight system do not      
permit instant removal of the gases from the ion source after they initially  
pass the ionization region. A component of randomized gas therefore           
contributes to the measurement. The ratio of the direct beaming to the        
randomized component strongly depends on the system geometry. A ratio of      
approximately 5:1 was achieved with the ion source design of the flight       
instrument. It is most critically affected by the distance between the        
electron beam and the capillary exit and the cross section of the electron    
beam.                                                                         
     A cross-sectional view of the actual ion source is shown in Figure 3. The
gas flow path for the second inlet system near leak L2 is marked by arrows.

designed to minimize clogging of the capillary leak array by condensible      
gases, e.g., water droplets should they exist. It is believed that the cloud  
particles on Jupiter are condensates in vapor pressure equilibrium with their 
surroundings. They are unlikely to clog any part of the inlet system, which is
considerably warmer than the ambient atmosphere and will quickly evaporate    
them. Large droplets, should they overcome the gravitational potential while  
moving through the inlet lines, will be trapped in the cup, shown for example 
at the bottom of Figure 3. Involatile smog particles, such as the concentrated
sulfuric acid on Venus are unlikely to be encountered. A droplet trap         
arrangement for inlet 1 is similar to that shown for inlet 2. Also shown in   
Figure 3 are the connecting vacuum flanges through which the sample gases     
coming from the first leak and the leaks that supply the enriched and purified
samples enter the ion source.                                                 
     The measurement sequence. illustrated in Figure 4(b), shows the time     
dependence of the total ion source pressure during the Probe descent. For     
reference the ambient pressure and temperature are shown in Figure 4(a) as a  
function of time. During the cruise phase of the mission all microvalves are  
open.

microvalves V1, V3, V4, V6, V7, and V8 are closed which is the initial        
condition for sampling. The first inlet breakoff is opened when the Probe     
reaches a pressure level of approximately 150 mb. Approximately one second    
later the first outlet breakoff is opened, causing the ambient atmosphere to  
flow past the capillary leak L1 through which a small fraction of the         
atmosphere is conducted into the ion source. While the direct analysis is     
made, valve V1 is opened for 8 min to allow ambient gas to flow through       
enrichment cell C1 until getter G2 is saturated with hydrogen and the getter  
housing volume is filled with gas. Next valves V1 and V5 are closed, valves V2
and V3 are opened and the remaining reactive gas, mostly hydrogen, is absorbed
by getter G1. Remaining in the enclosed volume are the noble gases and some   
residual hydrogen whose partial pressure is reduced by approximately five     
orders of magnitude determined by the equilibrium vapor pressure of the       
hydrogen dissolved in getter G1. In the third step valves V2 and V3 are closed
and valve V4 is opened introducing a fraction of the gas into the volume      
enclosed by valves V2, V3, and V4 through leak L3 into the ion source. Prior  
to opening valve V4, valves V10A and V10B are closed and the ion source and   
analyzer section of the mass spectrometer are evacuated to background via     
getters G5 and G8 and the sputter ion pump IP. Mass spectra are obtained      
during the pump down time to record the remaining background gases. The noble 
gases subsequently introduced into the ion source through leak L3 are analyzed
for 2.5 min. During this time enrichment cell C1 is heated for 5 min to 200   
degrees C, the gases are desorbed. and, after opening valve V3, they are added
to the noble gases flowing through L3 into the ion source. After 5.0 min of   
analysis of these gases during which the cell temperature is maintained at 200
degrees C, valve V11 is closed and the mass spectrometer is pumped once more  
to background pressure levels while the partial pressure of the background    
gases are measured. Inlet system 1 is now completely and irreversibly isolated
from the mass spectrometer and the sequence described is repeated with inlet  
system 2 for which a separate noble gas measurement cycle is not provided.    
Leak L2 cannot be isolated from the ion source in order to allow direct gas   
beaming into the ionization region. Hence, the contents of enrichment cell C2 
will be superimposed on the direct measurement as illustrated in Figure 4(b). 
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.3. ION SOURCE                                                               
                                                                              
     The importance of minimizing gas-surface interactions in the high vacuum 
side requires that the ion source be very compact and an integral part of the 
sample inlet system. Electron impact ionization is used in a miniature, dual  
filament ion source. The second filament provides redundancy and is turned on 
automatically should the first filament break or burn out. A collimated       
electron beam is directed through the ionization region past the capillary    
leak L2 shown schematically in Figure 1 and the physical location in Figure 3.
The electron beam energy is varied to permit species identification and       
discrimination by observing spectra of fragmentation patterns at several      
different electron energies. The other leaks L1, L3, and L4 are connected to  
the ionization region via short tubes as indicated schematically in Figure 1. 
Chemical reactions of gases on the surfaces of the hot filament are minimized 
by isolation through narrow slits and by separate pumping of the filament     
region. Ions are focused into the mass analyzer for filtering by a            
three-element ion lens.                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.4. QUADRUPOLE MASS ANALYZER                                                 
                                                                              
     The quadrupole mass filter was first described by Paul and Steinwedel    
(1953), and Paul et al. (1958). The reader is also referred to the book by    
Dawson (1976) for detailed discussions of quadrupole mass spectrometers and   
applications.                                                                 
     The quadrupole analyzer filters the ion beam produced by the ion source, 
transmitting ions of a chosen charge to mass ratio only. The transmitted ions 
are focused on a secondary electron multiplier detector. The radius of the    
quadrupole field is 5 mm and the field length is 150 mm. Mass selection is    
achieved by application of radio frequency and static potentials of varying   
magnitude to diagonal rod pairs. The selected mass value is determined by the 
relation m = 0.55V/f^2 (amu) where V is the amplitude of the applied          
radio-frequency voltage in V and f is the frequency in MHz. To allow voltage  
scanning over a sufficient amplitude range two separate radio frequencies were
used, 2.83 MHz for 2 to 19 amu and 1.13 MHz for 20 to 150 amu. The quadrupole 
mass filter has been chosen in preference to a magnetic sector spectrometer   
because of its light weight, versatility, high resolution, and simplicity. The
only dimensionally critical element in the system is the precision rod        
assembly whose rigid and compact design has been proven by application in     
previous flight experiments and vibration and temperature testing to be       
extremely stable.                                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.5. PUMPING SYSTEM                                                           
                                                                              
     The pumping system establishes a flow of sample gas though the ion source
at a particular pressure when a sampling device is opened, and, after analysis
and closure, removes the sample from the ion source region. Non-evaporable    
getters and a sputter ion pump are used because of their simple adaptation to 
space flight systems. They depend only on electrical power for operation,     
without moving parts. Their application to the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer
requires care because hydrogen and helium are the major gases in the          
atmosphere. While hydrogen is absorbed at a very high rate by getter          
materials, helium absorption is practically zero. Sputter ion pumps also pump 
hydrogen with high efficiency but hydrocarbons are synthesized in the pump by 
reactions of hydrogen ions with carbon trapped in the pump surfaces. The      
effective pumping speed for helium is usually small because of the low        
ionization cross section of helium and the requirement that helium be buried  
physically in the pump elements since it does not become chemically bound or  
go into solution like hydrogen. This requires sputtering of comparatively     
large amounts of cathode material which tends to release larger quantities of 
gases previously entrapped in the pump surfaces. Thus, to eliminate the       
synthesis of hydrocarbons in the sputter pump a cascaded pump system is used. 
A high capacity baffled getter pump is operated in cascade with a sputter ion 
pump. The gas flow from the mass spectrometer into the getter pump is         
conductance limited to maintain a constant pumping speed during the           
measurement phase. Hydrogen and all other reactive gases are adsorbed by the  
getter before they reach the sputter pump. Gases emitted by the pump pass the 
getter first before they can enter the mass spectrometer and their            
contribution to the ion source gas is therefore significantly reduced. Small  
sputter pump instabilities, not fully avoidable with the present state of     
technology, are buffered by the preceding getter chamber. The getter material 
used is sintered zirconium graphite available from SAES Getter of Milan, Italy
as type ST171. It is fabricated in a proprietary process. After activation at 
approximately 900 degrees C for 45 min while the instrument is connected to   
the laboratory vacuum pumping system, the getters remain active at room       
temperature until they become saturated at the end of the Probe descent.      
Getters G5 and G8 are dimensioned approximately five times larger than        
required for the gas load expected during the descent in order to maintain    
constant pumping speed. The cathode materials of the sputter ion pump are     
tantalum and titanium and the electrode geometry is optimized to enhance      
pumping of helium by ion implantation and burial. Pumping speed is conductance
limited at the pump flange to 21 s^-1. The magnetic field of the sputter ion  
pump is 0.2 Tesla over an effective area of 35 cm^2 . The yoke is designed to 
minimize the stray field. Magnetic shielding was also provided to the ion     
source housing to cancel the stray field of the pump because of its location  
directly above the ion source. The sample inlet system and vacuum pump        
assembly are shown in Figure 5.                                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.6. ELECTRONIC SYSTEM                                                        
                                                                              
     In adapting previous concepts for the electronics to the Galileo         
requirements, simplicity has been a major consideration. Power commands and   
timing events are accepted and processed by the logic system. The data of the 
primary measurement are stored in an output register for interrogation by the 
spacecraft telemetry system. A block diagram of the electronic system is shown
in Figure 6.                                                                  
     The instrument is under control of the programmer which is an array of   
Read-Only-Memory (ROM) devices which produces an 8192-word, 16-bit look-up    
table and an output register to hold the 16-bit word in current usage. Each   
one half second the ROM is incremented and the instrument is configured for   
the next measurement. Thus during each of 8192 one half second intervals each 
of six instrument variables, e.g., mass number, ionization energy, inlet      
system configuration, etc., can be configured to any allowable state. The     
application of power causes the instrument to begin executing a programmed 256
step 'test' sequence. The instrument remains locked in this 'test' mode until 
the SEQUENCE START command is received from the Probe.                        
     As mentioned above mass number selection in a quadrupole is a function of
amplitude and frequency of the RF signal applied to the rods. Two frequencies 
are being used to cover the mass range of 2 to 150 amu (Table VI). In each    
frequency range mass number is proportional to the RF amplitude. The actual   
mass scanning range is slightly larger than the nominal values quoted above   
for occasional high-resolution peak scanning past the center of the mass peaks
to verify tuning and mass resolution. The mass peak width is kept             
approximately constant over the mass range 2 to 150 amu by proper choice of   
the dc and RF voltages.                                                       
     The ion source requires an electrode supply of well-regulated voltages   
and a feedback

controlled emission regulator for the ionizing electron beam gun. For the     
Galileo application three different ionization energies are programmer        
selected by changing appropriate ion source potentials. The ion source, as    
previously noted, is provided with two redundant filaments which are powered  
by redundant emission regulators. This implementation simplifies the design   
and, of course, increases reliability.

detector. Command capability to optimize the secondary electron multiplier    
gain through the selection of one of four values is provided. The ion arrival 
rate at the detector during each one half second during the descent           
constitutes the primary measurement. Pulse counting will range from a rate of 
about 5 x 10^7 cts s^-1 down to rates as low as one count per half second     
integration. At ion arrival rates exceeding the upper count limit the         
instrument will be desensitized automatically. A logarithmic (base 2)         
compressor is used with a 9-bit mantissa and 4-bit exponent. This provides a  
full scale of 3 x 10^7 per range and a resolution of one part in 512.         
     The electronics system was constructed using multi-layer printed circuit 
board technology. Weight and size constraints for the Galileo Probe           
instruments required that approximately 90 percent of the electronics         
components were packaged in multi-layer hybrid form. To meet structural       
requirements the circuit boards were mounted on a cross web structure         
enclosing the quadrupole analyzer and ion detector section. A photograph of   
the electronics assembly is shown in Figure 7. The average power consumption  
of the electronics system is 13 W. Additional pump and heater power of 12 W   
maximum is required during the descent.                                       
     Since the Probe is not pressurized the instrument is enclosed by a       
pressurized envelope made of titanium to save weight. Pressurization (1.2 bar 
N2) prevents corona and condensation during the descent, and defers collapse. 
The weight of the instrument is 13.2 kg (29.11 lbs.). The fully assembled     
instrument is shown in Figure 8. Also shown in the figure are the inlet and   
outlet breakoff devices of the sample inlet system.                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.7. RELIABILITY AND REDUNDANCY                                               
                                                                              
     Much consideration is always given to reliability in the design of       
scientific space flight instruments. Of particular concern for the Galileo    
mission is the requirement for long instrument life which has increased from  
the original 3 years to more than 10 years. This increase was due to various  
programmatic changes in the mission and schedule delays caused by the tragic  
Challenger accident. Although there are no special long-life verification test
results available for the instrument, an examination of the materials and     
components used in the instrument let us conclude that we expect reliable     
operation of the instrument over the required time period.                    
     Of particular concern is the vacuum integrity of the mass spectrometer   
system. To maintain a sufficiently clean ion source environment for trace gas 
detection, it is necessary to keep the sample inlets and the analyzer section 
under high vacuum and sealed until the measurement sequence begins. Getter and
sputter ion pump loading due to small vacuum leaks from the pressurized       
housing or from surface outgassing can seriously degrade or even destroy the  
capacity of the instrument to perform during entry. However, leak and         
outgassing tests performed after pinch off from the vacuum stand and          
vibration tests indicated leak rates low enough to exceed the required        
lifetime by more than a factor of three. Post launch and first earth encounter
check out of the instrument also verified that the vacuum integrity was       
maintained during and after the launch and after vehicle separation maneuvers 
were completed. The background gas spectra obtained during the first Earth    
return of the spacecraft showed peaks of He, Ar,

CH4, H2O, CO, and CO2. Helium, argon and methane background pressures seen at 
the instant of turn on were 1 x 10^-9 mbar, 2 x 10^-9 mbar, and 2 x 10^-12    
mbar, respectively. This background was removed within several seconds by the 
sputter ion pump leaving a residual pressure of 1 x 10^-12 mbar for CH4 and   
CO2, 3 x 10^-12 mbar for H2O and less than 2 x 10^-13 mbar for He, Ar, and CO.

For the remaining cruise time the instrument will be turned on once a year to 
operate the sputter ion pump for removal of noble gases, e.g., Ar, resulting  
from possible sudden release from gas pockets which exist in metal surfaces   
and welds. It is also necessary to exercise the micro valves, the only devices
in the instrument containing moving parts, to prevent sticking under ultra    
high vacuum conditions. Since sticking in the closed position after long      
storage is the most likely failure mode of the valves, all valves are kept in 
the open position during the cruise phase of the mission.                     
     Component redundancy is implemented in spacecraft support systems, but is
usually not permitted in scientific instruments because of weight, size,      
power, and cost constraints. Hence, many single point failure possibilities   
exist in the instrument. Redundancy is provided, however, for the filaments   
because of the limited lifetime; for the pyrotechnic devices because of       
possible misfire; and for the isolation of inlet leak 1 by using two micro    
valves in series V10A and V10B because of catastrophic pressure increase in   
the ion source which would occur if the flow through leak 1 is not stopped at 
the designated closing time. The life expectancy of the electronic components 
in space is usually very high except for those which are radiation sensitive, 
e.g., microprocessors which are not part of our design.                       
     The sampling sequence for the nominal one hour descent time was          
programmed on read only memory (ROM). Programs could be changed or corrected  
on the ground by substituting ROM units in the instrument but it remains fixed
in flight. This approach avoided risks of radiation damage when using         
programmable onboard memory for which radiation hardened parts were not       
available.                                                                    
                                                                              
                  3. Laboratory Calibration of the Instrument                 
                                                                              
     Accurate instrument calibration is required for quantitative composition 
measurements in the atmosphere. The transfer characteristics of mass          
spectrometers depend on the species to be measured. Factors which affect      
signal levels include the ionization cross section, the effective pumping     
speed of the vacuum pumps, and the conversion efficiency and pulse height     
distribution of the secondary electron multiplier.                            
     The instrument was calibrated on a dynamic flow system where the time,   
pressure, and temperature profile to be encountered during the Probe descent  
was simulated. Gas mixtures containing known mixing ratios of cases expected  
in the atmosphere of Jupiter were introduced into the high pressure flow      
system connected to the sample inlet system of the flight instrument. Ultra-  
pure, commercially available gas mixtures were used. To establish mixing      
ratios representative of the atmosphere of Jupiter those mixtures were further
diluted with pure gases (H2 and He). The final mixing ratios of the minor     
constituents was checked or verified by a laboratory gas chromatograph mass   
spectrometer system as well as a stand-alone gas chromatograph and mass       
spectrometer. The design of the sample inlet system allowed complete and      
separate instrument calibration of all components used in flight except for   
the replacement of getter materials and the sputter ion pump. This was        
required after calibration to assure that maximum pump capacities are         
available for the experiment. All pumps on the flight instrument are designed 
to operate in a conductance limited mode so that small variations in pumping  
speed of the getter materials have a negligible effect on the instrument      
transfer function.                                                            
     The calibration system consists of two parts, the high-pressure gas flow 
and sample mixing system, and the ultra-high vacuum pumping stand. A schematic
diagram of the pressure flow system is shown in Figure 9. Calibration gas     
mixtures are circulated through loop L1 in the direction shown by the arrows. 
Two gas compressors are available for alternate use for gas compression and   
circulation through the circulating loop. They operate over the pressure range
from 10 mbar to 2 bar and 1.0 to 20 bar. The flight instrument inlets and     
outlets were connected directly with vacuum flanges to the appropriate        
terminals as indicated in the schematic on the left side of Figure 9. All     
lines are thermally insulated and the gas temperature was controlled by       
heaters attached to the flow lines and heat exchangers CT1 and CT2 to heat or 
cool the circulating gas mixture as required. Absolute system pressure was    
monitored with pressure gauge PG1 and the differential pressure across the    
inlet was monitored with gauge DPG. The flow was adjusted so that the         
differential pressure was always equal to the Probe stagnation pressure (6    
mbar) expected in flight. Trace gas mixtures were added in known quantities   
through the calibration gas line and valve VC. The exact quantities of added  
calibration gas was determined by measuring the gas flow with the flow meters

     The ultra-high vacuum pumping system was connected to the flight         
instrument through pumpout ports for evacuation, bake out at ~300 degrees C   
and getter pump activation. This is needed before calibration can begin and   
between calibration runs for getter reactivation and final instrument         
preparation for flight. Oil-free turbomolecular pumps and a closed circuit    
liquid helium pump provided the pumping capacity and ultra-high vacuum        
capability needed for thorough and rapid evacuation of the flight instrument  
system. Typical background pressures in the instrument, before calibration    
gases were introduced, were between 5 x 10^-11 mbar and 2 x 10^-10 mbar where 
the major component was H2 followed by H2O, CO, and CO2.                      
     Detailed calibration was carried out with the gas mixtures containing    
primarily H2 and He 10 percent plus trace gases each at the 100 ppmv mixing   
ratio. A list of the calibration gases used either directly or in various     
combinations is given in Table VII.

Calibration gas mixture used to calibrate the GPMS. The mixture consisted of  
either H2 or H2 90 percent and He 10 percent. and trace gases as indicated    
each at the 100 to 150 ppmv mixing ratios.                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
To establish detailed relative sensitivities of the trace constituents with   
respect to H2 and He and to evaluate the fractionation pattern at the three   
energy levels of the ionizing electron beams, the gas mixtures were           
introduced into the sample inlet system without further dilution, i.e., with  
trace gas mixing ratios each of order of 100 ppmv but at several fixed        
pressure levels between 100 mbar and 20 bar. Finally the descent profile,     
i.e., pressure and temperature vs time was simulated in the high-pressure flow
system exposing the flight instrument to flight-like operating conditions.    
Predicted pressure-time and temperature-time profiles shown in Figure 4(a)    
were approximated as closely as possible for that test. All calibration data  
were recorded and processed on automated data processing equipment using      
software generated during the instrument development phase.                   
                                                                              
     Some concern has been expressed that the presence of hydrogen in the ion 
source might impede the measurement of isotope ratios. Tests of the noble gas 
mixture with and without added H2 at high ion source pressure, where hydride  
formation should be most pronounced, showed that the effect in flight will be 
too small to be observed. In addition, the purification cell efficiently      
removes the hydrogen and further alleviates any possible concern for the      
measurement of noble gas isotope ratios. This system shows great promise for  
the measurement of helium-3. An example of this is given in the graphic       
illustration shown in Figure 10 for H2 and He. The purification permits the   
3He isotope to be measured well above background. Tests also verified that the
carbon isotope ratio measurement using the methane spectrum is not affected by
hydride formation in the ion source as shown in Table VIII.

     Since it was not possible to calibrate the flight instrument with all the
gases which might be found in the atmosphere of Jupiter and since the         
unambiguous interpretation of mass spectra obtained in flight can be          
difficult, a laboratory reference unit has been built. The engineering unit   
instrument was refurbished to be identical to the flight instrument. Post     
encounter simulations of flight results are planned using the laboratory unit 
and the calibration system to further aid in the data interpretation by       
reproducing experimentally as close as possible the data obtained in flight   
using various test gas mixtures.

spectrum shows a 90 percent hydrogen-10 percent helium mixture through direct

the hydrogen has been removed by the getter to the background level. The      
helium decrease in the bottom spectrum is from the volume expansion in the    
getter volume. (b) Top spectrum is a pure helium sample through direct leak 2

The helium 3 level in this example is approximately 10^-7 below the helium 4

equipment introducing also extra system noise at low level signals.           
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
               4. Expected Results and Measurement Accuracies                 
                                                                              
     The objective of this experiment, as stated above, is the measurement of 
the chemical composition of the atmosphere of Jupiter, i.e., the mixing ratio 
of the major and minor constituents during the Probe descent. The basic       
accuracy of the measurements and the detection limits of trace gases are      
determined by the sensitivity of the instrument, the maximum operating        
pressure of the ion source and the dynamic range of the mass spectrometer. The
ion source sensitivity varies with species depending on the ionization cross  
sections, for example, the sensitivity is 1.6 x 10^13 counts per second mbar  
for helium and 8.9 x 10^12 counts per second mbar for hydrogen.  The          
background count rate of the secondary electron multiplier ion detector is    
less than 0.1 counts per second. An ion source pressure of 2 x 10^-5 mbar will
be reached at the end of the direct leak 1 and leak 2 measurement phases and  
during the enrichment cell analysis periods. The exact ion source pressure    
cannot, of course, be predicted since assumptions had to be made about the    
descent pressure-time profiles. A maximum ion source pressure of 1 x 10^-4    
mbar is acceptable.                                                           
     In the spectral regions where the maximum dynamic range of the instrument
can be used, the accuracy will be limited by pulse counting statistics at low 
mixing ratios. At large mixing ratios where counting statistics become        
negligible, the measurement accuracy will be +- 2 percent for peak height     
ratio measurements of adjacent mass peaks and +- 10 percent for peak height   
ratios with wide mass separation. This is because of the accumulation         
resulting from calibration uncertainties, small temperature drifts in the     
supply electronics and change in the gain of the secondary electron           
multiplier.                                                                   
     In the analysis of gas mixtures, ambiguities in species identification   
and additional accuracy limitations are expected for species with overlapping 
mass spectra. Some ambiguities will be resolved by using different energies   
for the ionizing electron beam. This will be effective for species with       
strongly differing ionization potentials and dependent ionization and         
dissociation cross sections. Space flight constraints of low weight, power,   
and volume put restrictions on the size of vacuum pumps and thus limiting the 
admissible sample size and the achievable background pressure. The available  
power for the RF generator for the quadrupole puts limits on the achievable   
mass resolution. The short descent time also restricts the chance for         
extensive signal averaging. This is particularly important for traces of      
reactive gases which may initially be absorbed or decomposed on the surfaces  
of the sample inlet system before they reach the ion source. Reactions of     
hydrogen with loosely bound carbon or oxygen on the vacuum surfaces in the ion
source regions cause the formation of methane and water vapor. This effect    
was significantly suppressed by surface processing, e.g., carbon depletion and
formation of stable surface oxides. Methane and water vapor buildup in a      
hydrogen atmosphere are, however, still limiting the measurement accuracy for 
these gases.                                                                  
     Early methane concentration measurements will therefore be most accurate,
e.g., +- 10 percent at the expected mixing ratio of 10^-4. Measurements made  
near the end of the mission are expected to be uncertain by a factor of two.  
Water vapor measurements in the mid pressure range (~ 7 bar) are expected to  
be also uncertain by a factor of two if the mixing ratio is ~10^-5. Better    
accuracies ( +- 50 percent ) are expected if the mixing ratios are close to   
solar values of ~10^-3. Other gases causing chemical noise are carbon         
monoxide, carbon dioxide, and ethane. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide form 
a constant background of several hundred counts per second which does not     
appear to change significantly when hydrogen enters the ion source. Ethane, on
the other hand, does not occur in the background spectrum prior to exposure to
hydrogen but it appears in small quantities of 1 ppmv levels when hydrogen    
enters the inlet. This background level can conceivably change in flight      
depending on its origin. If ethane is formed in a similar method as methane   
the background is expected to be the same as during the laboratory tests.     
Should ethane slowly accumulate on the vacuum surfaces and be desorbed when   
hydrogen is introduced, the ethane background could become larger or smaller  
depending on which process, outgassing or pumping, is dominating over the long
time period of the cruise phase of the mission. The background level of ethane
will ultimately determine the detection threshold of gases with similar       
fragmentation patterns such as silane, ethylene, and acetylene.               
     No background gases or chemical noise is expected above mass 44 at high  
ion source pressures and hence constituent measurement accuracies in this     
region are expected to be determined by the statistical uncertainties         
associated with the respective sampling times at low concentrations or by the 
uncertainties caused by temperature drift, etc., to +- 10 percent as stated   
above at large concentration levels. Examples of gases which will be detected 
in this higher, chemically cleaner mass range are krypton, xenon, arsine, and 
the higher molecular weight hydrocarbons.                                     
     Reactive trace gases of particular interest which are affected by surface
adsorption or reactions are ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and        
phosphine (PH3). All three gases are transmitted without delay or apparent    
surface loss through inlet 2 because of the direct gas beaming feature of the 
ion source. Ammonia, the most reactive gas of the set, will not be transmitted
to the ion source from leak 1 at a mixing ratio of ~10^-5 in any reasonable   
amount of time for a measurement. Evaporating cloud droplets are expected to  
be detectable, however, although quantitative calibration was not possible    
because of lack of time and facilities to produce droplets in known quantities
during the calibration and evaluation period. Spectral interference with      
methane at mass 17(13CH4) will limit the detection threshold of ammonia       
through leak 2 to a mixing ratio of approximately 10^-5 (equal signal from    
ammonia and methane). Hydrogen sulfide is measurable through inlet 1 after a  
few seconds delay depending on the mixing ratio. At the predicted mixing ratio
of ~10^-5 we expect a +- 50 percent accuracy of the measurement. Transmission 
of phosphine was observed without any noticeable delays and the measurement   
accuracy will be primarily affected by spectral interference at the parent    
peak from hydrogen sulfide. Phosphine can be measured, however, by observing  
the mass 31 peak which occurs with an intensity of 0.25 of the parent peak and
is free from spectral interference except from ethane (13C12CH6). Assuming the
predicted composition and carbon isotope ratio of ethane, the phosphine mixing
ratio will be determined at least to a factor of two at the 10^-7 mixing      
ratio. Enrichment factors of 100 are expected for ethane and propane and of   
500 for higher order hydrocarbons. Krypton and xenon will be enriched         
approximately 10 times and 100 times, respectively. The actual accuracies can 
only be established after the data are received and analyzed, because the     
spectral interference depends on the actual data and background gas           
uncertainties resulting from the long storage and cruise time.                
                                                                              
                                                                              
                         5. Sampling Sequence Summary                         
                                                                              
     A brief description of the sampling sequence which will be followed by   
the instrument during the entry phase is given below.                         
                                                                              
     The instrument contains an unalterably programmed 8192 step sampling     
sequence designed to optimize the data return at a sampling rate of two steps 
per second. The SEQUENCE START command is sent from the Probe Command and Data
System to the instrument after the Probe parachute has been deployed and the  
heat shield has been jettisoned. All reference times quoted are with respect  
to the SEQUENCE START command. The ambient pressure values were taken from the
engineering pressures vs descent time model provided by the Galileo Project.  
After an automatic self-configuration which includes setting valves and       
heaters in the proper positions for the operations that follow, the instrument
measurement sequence begins at t = 1.97 min, P ~ 0.1 bar by monitoring the    
'residual' gas content (background).                                          
                                                                              
Photochemical Sampling                                                        
                                                                              
     Inlet 1 and Outlet 1 open at t = 2.66 min, P ~ 0.15 bar to expose the    
first gas handling system to the ambient atmosphere. The atmosphere will be   
sampled in seven sequences where data corresponding to masses 2-4, 12-68,     
72-78, 80-84, 122, and 124 amu are transmitted.                               
                                                                              
NH3 Cloud Sampling                                                            
                                                                              
     In the region where ammonia (NH3) cloud are predicted, t = 6.70 min, P ~ 
0.7 bar, the mass range from 2 to 150 is scanned seven times. Approximately   
every 30 s (delta P = 0.1 bar), the scan is interrupted to repeat the         
measurements at masses 14-18. 32-36, 64, and 66 amu.                          
                                                                              
Filling of Enrichment Cell 1 and Rare Gas Cell                                
                                                                              
     During direct sampling in the photochemical region, the enrichment cell  
C1 is exposed to the ambient atmosphere; t = 4.71 min, P ~ 0.4 bar until t =  
13.05 min, P ~ 1.9 bar. After isolation of the cell from the ambient          
atmosphere, gases not trapped by the sorbent material of the cell are expanded
into the rare gas cell; t = 13.12 min to t = 16.10 min.                       
                                                                              
Background Gas Observation                                                    
                                                                              
     At time t = 17.06 min the instrument inlet system is closed to allow     
observation of background gases accumulated during the measurement phase. The 
baseline condition is monitored by executing two decremental integer mass     
sweeps over the range of 150 to 2 amu and four measurements in the 0.125 amu  
mass incremental mode at masses 28, 44, 16, and 4 amu.                        
                                                                              
Rare Gas Sampling                                                             
                                                                              
     The rare gas cell content is analyzed from t = 19.98 min to t = 22.40 min
in six sequences. The first and last sequences include mass sweeps over the   
range 2-28 amu plus those masses corresponding to the isotopes of Kr and Xe.  
The other sequences monitor those masses corresponding to the isotopes of He, 
Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. To separate Ne from Ar++ several scans are made at an     
ionization energy of 25 eV.                                                   
                                                                              
Rare Gas and First Enrichment Cell Sampling                                   
                                                                              
     At t = 22.40 min the enrichment cell C1 processed sample from the        
enrichment cell is added to the rare gas cell sample for analysis. Four       
sequences are performed: 3 sweeps of the mass range 2-150 amu, and 1 covering 
masses 2-87 amu and 123-137 amu. An ionization energy of 15 eV is used during 
one full mass scan.                                                           
                                                                              
Background Gas Observation                                                    
                                                                              
     After the enrichment cell analysis the cell is sealed off and the        
analyzer is pumped down to background pressure. At t = 27.78 min the          
instrument program executes three sequences where the background gas content  
is recorded once more after the enrichment cell analysis. Two mass scans cover
the mass range 150-2 amu while the third mass scan covers masses 68-2 amu.    
                                                                              
Direct Atmospheric Sampling                                                   
                                                                              
     The second gas inlet system is opened to the ambient atmosphere starting 
at t = 30.99 min, P ~ 7.0 bar and remains open until the end of the mission.  
Thirty-one sampling sequences are performed, twenty covering the mass range   
2-150 amu, two scan the 2-68 amu region while the other nine monitor selected 
masses. Selected scans are also programmed for ionization energies of either  
15 eV or 25 eV.                                                               
                                                                              
Filling of Enrichment Cell 2 and Analysis                                     
                                                                              
     While sampling the atmosphere directly, enrichment cell C2 will be filled
from time t = 31.68 min to time t = 33.27 min corresponding to a predicted    
pressure range from P ~ 7.3 to 7.8 bar. Following the isolation of the cell   
from the gas handling system, sample processing begins. The sample analysis   
will start at t = 38.99 min and end at t = 46.40 min. The predicted pressure  
levels are P ~ 10.0 to 13.0 bar, respectively. During this time, five scans   
covering the mass range from 2-150 amu are performed. The ionization energies 
chosen for these scans is 75, 15, 75, 25, and 75 eV.                          
                                                                              
High-Mass Resolution Scan                                                     
                                                                              
     A high-resolution mass scan for selected mass ranges (2-46, 47-90,       
121-140) amu is performed at t = 48.97 min, P ~ 14.0 bar. During this scan, a 
mass step size of 0.125 amu is used.                                          
                                                                              
End of Mission Sequence                                                       
                                                                              
     At the completion of the High-Mass Resolution Scan at t = 59 min, P ~    
19.0 bar, the instrument will begin repeating a 2-150 amu scan every 75 s     
until the end of mission.
