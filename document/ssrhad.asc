Abstract.                                                                     
                                                                              
     We discuss the scientific objective, instrument design, and calibration  
of a miniaturized Jamin-Mascart interferometer which is to perform an accurate
measurement of the refractive index of the Jovian atmosphere in the pressure  
range 2.5 to 10 bar. The instrument is to perform this measurement in December
1995 aboard the entry probe of the NASA Galileo spacecraft. From the data     
obtained the mole fraction of helium in the atmosphere of Jupiter is to be    
calculated with an estimated uncertainty of +- 0.0015. The instrument has a   
total mass of 1.4 kg and consumes 0.9 W of electrical power.

     Hydrogen and helium are by far the most abundant elements in the         
Universe, the stars, the Sun, and the outer planets. If known, the mixing     
ratios of these elements in stellar and planetary bodies provide important    
constraints for theories about their origin and evolution. Yet, considerable  
uncertainty exists for these mixing ratios because they are difficult to      
measure.                                                                      
     The NASA Galileo mission to the planet Jupiter provides us with the first
opportunity to measure the He/H2 abundance ratio inside a heavenly body and   
with high accuracy. To this end, the Galileo entry probe carries a            
miniaturized interferometer which is to perform an accurate measurement of the
refractive index of the Jovian atmosphere, after removal of NH3, H2O, and CH4,
in the pressure range from 2.5 to 10 bar. From these data the helium mole     
fraction (about 0.10) can be calculated with an estimated accuracy of +-      
0.0015. The instrument is called the Helium Abundance Detector, or HAD for    
short. It has a mass of 1.4 kg and an electrical power consumption of less    
than 1 W. Before it can perform its measurements within the Jovian atmosphere,
the HAD instrument has to survive an in-space-storage period of more than 6   
years, a radiation dose of 75 krad and a deceleration during entry into the   
Jovian atmosphere of approximately 300 g.

     In astrophysics, element abundances are commonly quoted as mass          
fractions, whereas in planetary atmosphere studies these abundances are       
usually given as mole fractions (equivalent to mixing ratios). As we cannot   
avoid using both terminologies, we provide in Table I rigorous definitions of 
the more relevant abundance measures.

2.1. BACKGROUND                                                               
                                                                              
     Current theory holds that almost all of the hydrogen and helium now      
residing in the Universe formed billions of years ago in a cosmic fireball,   
called the Big Bang. It is of obvious scientific interest to find out what    
mass fractions these two elements had attained after the initial cool-down of 
the fireball and before additional, though limited, synthesis of helium in    
stars began. If known, the primordial mass fractions of H and He provide      
important constraints for theories trying to explain the formation and        
evolution of the Universe. The subject of the primordial helium abundance was 
treated extensively at an ESO workshop (Shaver et al., 1983). Recent reviews  
of He observations and of the standard Big-Bang theory put the primordial     
helium mass fraction Y_p into the range 0.23 <= Y_p <= 0.24 (e.g., Yang et    
al., 1984; Pagel, 1989). The quoted range of uncertainty can be reduced by    
accepting the latest correction to the half-life of the neutron (Paul et al., 
1989).                                                                        
     After synthesis of the primordial helium in the Big Bang some additional 
helium has been produced by nuclear burning of hydrogen inside stars. Until   
the time of formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago, this process 
increased the helium mass ratio in the Universe by DeltaY. Hence, one would   
assume the solar system to be formed from a pre-solar nebula having a helium  
mass ratio Y_s = Y_p + DeltaY. The value of Y_s has turned out to be          
notoriously difficult to establish. Gough (1983) estimates 0.23 <= Y_s <=     
0.27. Stix (1989) writes: "...we see that presently the most accurate method  
to determine the solar abundance is the computation of solar models, and the  
adjustment of these models to the present Sun by a proper choice of the mass  
fraction Y_s of He. Virtually all standard solar models calculated so far     
yield Y_s values between 0.23 and 0.28."                                      
     In view of the astrophysical importance of the value of Y_s alternate    
approaches to just studying the Sun seem justified to arrive at a             
determination of Y_s. One alternative is to assume that the giant planets, in 
particular Jupiter and Saturn, have also been formed with the pre-solar helium
mass fraction Y_s and that they have preserved it until today. Indeed, when   
the preparations for the HAD experiment began during 1976, many scientists    
assumed that the relative abundances of helium were equal in Jupiter, Saturn, 
and the Sun (see Lewis, 1974; Podolak and Cameron, 1975). At that time, the   
helium abundance in the atmosphere of Jupiter was, however, only poorly known.
Orton and Ingersoll (1976) summarized the then available remote sensing       
measurements as indicating a Jovian He mole fraction q_He = 0.12 +- 0.06,     
which for a H2 + He atmosphere is equivalent to Y_j = 0.214 +- 0.11. It does  
not appear to be very difficult to reduce the large uncertainty of either     
value significantly by a simple in-situ experiment aboard the Galileo entry   
probe.                                                                        
     So far we have implicitly made the assumption that the giant planets have
a uniform composition throughout. Only then would a He mole fraction measured 
in the atmosphere of one of these planets resemble the bulk composition of    
that planet. As early as 1967 doubt was expressed about the validity of this  
assumption for different reasons (e.g., Smoluchowski, 1967; Salpeter, 1973).  
In addition, the processes, which were postulated to lead to an inhomogeneous 
composition of the giant planets, are of varying effectiveness in the         
different planets. Hence, the notion of similar He abundances in the          
atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun also needed reconsideration.      
However, it was only after 1979 that those doubts could be verified           
experimentally through data obtained by the two Voyager spacecrafts. Today it 
appears established that (a) the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus   
each accommodate a different He mole fraction q_He, and that (b) the          
atmosphere of Jupiter contains somewhat less He than that of the Sun. This    
follows from the Voyager data concerning the helium abundances in the         
atmospheres of the giant planets (Table II).

     The helium mass fractions Y for Uranus and the Sun, though uncertain,    
seem to agree; for Saturn, and perhaps Jupiter, helium may have been          
gravitationally separated in the form of 'raindrops' which may form at the    
high interior pressures (for a current review see Hubbard, 1989). Thus, it has
become apparent that there is no simple relation between the current helium   
abundance in the atmospheres of the giant planets and that of the pre-solar   
nebula. Yet, the unexpectedly large differences in the He abundances of the   
giant planet atmospheres are themselves of eminent scientific interest and    
provide major inputs for our understanding of the origin and evolution of     
these atmospheres, as well as their energy balance.                           
     We do not expect to observe any change of the He mole fraction over the  
(very limited) pressure range that we sample in the Jovian atmosphere. This is
because the time scale for vertical mixing by turbulence is almost certainly  
much shorter than that for any process causing gravitational separation of He 
and H2.                                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
2.2. SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE                                                     
                                                                              
     The foremost scientific aim of the HAD experiment is to obtain an        
accurate measurement of the He abundance in the Jovian atmosphere. This datum 
will more accurately define the small difference between the helium mass      
fractions of Jupiter and the Sun and the large differences in the He mass     
fractions among the atmospheres of the giant planets. Beyond that, the helium 
mass fraction in the Jovian atmosphere represents an important lower boundary 
for the helium abundance in the pre-solar nebula. As such, it also impacts on 
theories about the origin of the solar system as a whole.

     More than 99.5 percent of the Jovian atmosphere consists of hydrogen and 
helium. Hence, to a first approximation, we can consider this atmosphere to be
a binary gas mixture, for which the mole fraction q_He of helium can be       
derived from the ratio of refractive indices                                  
                                                                              
         n_H2 - n_j

with n_He the refractive index of helium; n_H2, refractive index of hydrogen; 
n_j, refractive index of the H2 + He mixture (= Jovian gas).                  
     The refractive index of gases is usually measured interferometrically and
any two-beam interferometer can be used for this purpose. We have chosen a    
Jamin interferometer (see Jenkins and White, 1976), a schematic of which is   
shown in Figure 1. Let us assume that beam 1 passes through a sample gas cell 
CS filled with the Jovian gas and beam 2 passes through another gas cell CR   
filled with a reference gas of refractive

between the beams then becomes                                                
                                                                              
     OPD = (n_j - n_ref)L                                                     
                                                                              
and the order m of the interference pattern at the detector is                
                                                                              
     m =   OPD/lambda,                                                        
                                                                              
hence,                                                                        
                                                                              
     n_j = n_ref + lambda/L * m                                               
                                                                              
In order to account for variations of the pressure p and gas temperature T in 
the gas cells we assume that refractive indices n vary with p and T as        
follows:                                                                      
                                                                              
                                       pT_0                                   
     n(p, T) - 1 = {n(p_0, T_0) - 1}  ------  ,                               
                                       P_0T                                   
                                                                              
with p_0, T_0 are the standard pressure and temperature (=STP); n(p_0, T_0) = 
n_0, refractive index at STP.                                                 
                                                                              
     This yields

     Usually, the absolute value of m is not known. We can, however, measure  
the number of interference fringes Delta m while going from an initial state  
(i) to an end state (e) in pressures and temperatures. Let us assume that we  
start our measurement with evacuated gas cells (p_j,i = p_ref,i = 0). We then 
obtain for the end of the measurement

the end of the measurement; P_ref,e, T_ref,e, pressure and temperature in the 
reference gas cell at the end of the measurement; Delta m = m_e - m_i.        
     We now introduce Delta p_e = p_j,e - p_ref,e,  the pressure difference   
between the two gas cells at the end of the measurement; Delta T_e = T_j,e -  
T_ref,e, the difference in temperature of the gases in two gas cells at the   
end of the measurement which allows us to develop (5) in combination with (1) 
into our final equation for determining the helium mole fraction q_He

     Before evaluating (6) quantitatively we would like to note the following 
two items:                                                                    
                                                                              
     First, at high pressures it is the so-called Lorentz-Lorenz function LL  
which is independent of temperature, pressure, and density rho (Lorentz,      
1909). LL is given by                                                         
                                                                              
           n^2 - 1      1                                                     
     LL = --------- * -----   .                                               
           n^2 + 2     rho                                                    
                                                                              
For n ~ 1 the Lorentz-Lorenz function can be approximated to                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
     LL = 2/3 * (n-1)/rho                                                     
                                                                              
and, hence, yields (3). The application of (7) instead of (3) to our HAD      
experiment and inclusion of the compressibility of real gases has been studied
in detail by Schulte (1983).                                                  
     Second, so far we have neglected the small amount of trace constituents  
in the Jovian atmosphere. In light of the desired accuracy of our helium      
measurement, this neglect needs further consideration. In fact, we have either
to remove the trace gases from the Jovian gas sample before the refractive    
index is measured or we have to apply numerical corrections to the result     
obtained from (6). These corrections would depend on information from sources 
other than the HAD about the ambient abundances of NH3, H2O, and CH4. We have 
elected to remove these trace gases before measuring the refractive index     
(Schutze, 1986), because in the alternative approach it appears difficult to  
establish how much of the ambient NH3 and H2O in fact enters the              
interferometer gas cells.                                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
3.2. INSTRUMENT DESIGN                                                        
                                                                              
     The Galileo Helium Abundance Detector uses a two-arm, double-pathlength  
interferometer or Jamin-Mascart interferometer (Mascart, 1874). This type of  
interferometer allows for a particularly compact and simple design (Figure 2).
The light source (1) is a light emitting diode (LED) operating at a wavelength
of 900 nm. An interference filter (2) with a 15 nm passband aids in producing 
near-monochromatic light. A Jamin plate (4) produces two parallel and coherent
light beams (5 and 6). Four cells, each of length l = 100 mm, house the Jovian
gas (7) and the reference gas (8). Additional optical elements are the        
collimator (3), the inversion prism (9), and the objective (10). The inversion
prim is very slightly tilted about an axis parallel to the incoming light     
beams. This feature, in combination with the objective produces a well-defined
interference pattern of consecutive equidistant bright and dark fringes at a  
linear array of nine photodetectors (12). This pattern does not change if both
cells are filled with gas mixtures having the same refractive index. However, 
any differences between the refractive indices of the Jovian and the reference
gas causes a continuous shifting of the pattern with increasing pressure (that
is, as the entry probe penetrates deeper into the Jovian atmosphere). The     
detector allows measurement of the position and motion of the interference    
fringes in multiples of 1/8 of the fringe separation.                         
     The instrument carries a simple optical test device (11) which allows a  
measurement of the contrast of the interference fringes and a verification of 
the operation of the fringe counter during Earth-based tests and the          
interplanetary cruise of the Galileo spacecraft. It consists of a             
plane-parallel glass plate mounted between the objective (10) and the

detector array (12). By telemetry command this plate can be slowly tilted up  
to about 30 degrees about an axis parallel to the interference fringes at the 
detector. This causes a lateral shift of the interference pattern across the  
detector array.                                                               
     Figure 3 shows a schematic of the gas flow system of the HAD instrument. 
After entering the Instrument at I, the Jovian gas is passed through a        
two-stage chemical absorber (A1 and A2) to be scrubbed first of traces of NH3 
and H2O and then of CH4. In addition, immediately before entering the gas     
cells (CS, CR) the Jovian and the reference gases are each passed through heat
exchangers (H) made of stainless steel wool to fully accommodate the gas      
temperatures to that of the surrounding metal structure.                      
     The reference gas consists of a mixture of argon and neon having the same
refractive index as a mixture of 11.1 percent He and 88.9 percent H2. The     
reference gas is carried within the instrument in a storage volume (R) of     
about 20 cm^3 at a pressure of 25 bar. During the descent into the Jovian     
atmosphere the reference gas is released into its interferometer cells (CR) by
means of a membrane valve (V). It keeps the differential pressure between the 
Jovian gas cell (CS) and the reference gas cell (CR) near 75 mbar. The latter 
value is nearly independent of the total pressure because opening of the valve
is largely determined by the pressure difference across the membrane (and the 
elastic constant of the membrane). This pressure difference is measured by a  
pressure sensor (PD) within

a few millibar to fully account for the influence of this pressure            
differential on the observed fringe motion.                                   
     During launch and cruise of the Galileo spacecraft towards Jupiter the   
entrance orifice of the instrument for Jovian gas is closed by a thin metal   
diaphragm (B1). This diaphragm is designed to burst upon reaching an outside  
pressure of 2.5 bar. Subsequently, the ambient pressure actuates a needle     
device (M) which pinches a hole in a second diaphragm (D) which previously had
closed off the reference gas in its storage volume (R). Both gases are then   
passed into the interferometer through capillaries (C) which limit the initial
rate of pressure increase inside the interferometer cells to 50 mbar s^-1.    
Measurements are to continue until the reference gas is expanded to the local 
ambient pressure which should occur near 12 bar ambient pressure. Recent      
calculations of the descent profile of the entry probe predict that it will   
take the entry probe

about 28 min to descend from 2.5 to 12 bar ambient pressure. The fringe       
counter measures the motion of the interference pattern starting from vacuum  
conditions through the 'in-rush' period near 2.5 bar ambient pressure and up  
to 12 bar.                                                                    
     The structure carrying the optical elements of the interferometer, the   
gas flow elements, the storage volume for the reference gas, 3 pressure       
sensors, and 4 temperature sensors is machined from beryllium. This material  
was chosen for its high mechanical rigidity, low specific mass, and good      
thermal conductivity. A photograph of the fully assembled flight instrument is
shown in Figure 4.  A concise list of its important parameters is given in    
Table III.                                                                    
     To save energy, the LED is powered only for 0.5 ms at 64 Hz. Also, the   
fringe position is measured 64 times per second which allows the fringe       
counter to follow the fringe motions for pressure surges of up to 750 mbar    
s^-1. The average power consumption of the HAD instrument is 0.9 W.           
     One telemetry data frame of the HAD instrument consists of 256 bits and  
is transmitted every 64 s. It contains the content of the fringe counter, the 
readings from 3 precision pressure sensors, 4 precision temperature sensors, a
number of housekeeping channels and the analog signal of one of the           
photodetectors. The latter should enable us to obtain a reasonable result from
the HAD experiment even if the logic of the fringe counter fails.

     The sensitivity S of the HAD instrument is given by the change Delta m of
the order of the interference pattern for a given change Delta q_He of the He 
mole fraction: S = Delta m/Delta q_He. S is obtained directly from the second 
term of (6)                                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                      p_j,eT_0L                               
          S = (n_H2,0 - n_He,0) * -----------------   .

     Inserting the parameters as given in Table IV yields S = 222. Hence, if  
the genuine helium abundance deviates by 1 percent (Delta q_He = 0.01) from   
the value simulated by the reference gas (q_He = 0.111), the fringe counter   
would register a change Delta m of 2.22 fringes between 0 and 10 bar ambient  
pressure. For any value of q_He within the error bar of the q_He measurement  
of Conrath et al. (1984) we would obtain Delta m <= 7. As will be shown in the
section on HAD calibrations, the coherence length of the LED/filter           
combination makes the HAD instrument capable of producing more than 50        
interference fringes.                                                         
     The accuracy expected from the HAD experiment for determining the helium 
mole fraction is evaluated using (6). The error bar on the measured q_He      
depends to some measure on the uncertainty of each of the 10 variables        
entering (6). However, different variables affect the final result of q_He in 
quite different ways. Here it should suffice to point out only the most       
critical ones.                                                                
     We will denote with 1q_He the first term on the right-hand side of       
Equation (6)                                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
                    n_H2,0 - n_ref,0                                          
          1q_He = --------------------   .                                    
                    n_H2,0 - n_He,0                                           
                                                                              
Substituting n_ref,0 from our standard reference gas we obtain                
                                                                              
          1q_He = 0.110883 .                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
     An error delta 1q_He calculated by using the uncertainties listed in     
Table IV has no direct relevance for the HAD experiment, because the value of 
1q_He was verified by laboratory calibrations of the HAD. Each calibration    
consisted of a complete simulation of the descent of the HAD flight instrument
into a hydrogen + helium atmosphere to pressure levels of at least 10 bar. All
of these calibrations employed the same standard reference gas mixture in the 
HAD and hydrogen + helium mixtures surrounding the HAD instrument. Three      
hydrogen + helium mixtures were commercially procured and employed in the     
calibrations, each of them having a helium mole fraction of about 0.11, known 
with an accuracy of delta q_He <= 6 x 10^-5. In many dozens of such           
calibration runs, the HAD instrument measured with great precision the correct
q_He of the commercial H2 + He mixtures with an accuracy delta q_He better    
than 1 x 10^-3, where 1q_He = 0.110883 was used to calculate the final result.
This proves that when we use a value of 0.110883 for this ratio (in           
combination with our standard reference gas) its uncertainty has no           
significant effect on our q_He determination.                                 
     We will denote with 2q_He the second term on the right-hand side of      
Equation (6). Again using the parameters of Table IV, one obtains             
                                                                              
                                                                              
     2q_He = 4.511 x 10^-3 Delta m.                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
     The error delta 2q_He vanishes entirely in the case that Delta m goes    
to zero. In the idealized case of Delta p_e = Delta T_e = 0, this happens when
n_j = n_ref. Under these circumstances the uncertainties of T_j,0, P_j,0,     
lambda, L, and the two refractive indices do not enter at all, which is the   
basic advantage and incentive for performing a 'differential' measurement.    
     Of all the parameters entering 2q_He it is the error delta p_j,e which   
has the largest effect on delta 2q_He. In Table IV, delta p_j,e/p_j,e is      
(conservatively) given as +- 0.01. Hence, considering (11), delta p_j,e alone 
causes an error delta 2q_He = +- 4.5 x 10^-5 Delta m. Taking the other        
parameters in 2q_He into account as well, this error rises slightly to        
                                                                              
     delta 2q_He = +- 5.1 x 10^-5 Delta m .                                   
                                                                              
     As outlined above, Delta m will be always smaller than 7 for 0.08 <= q_He
<= 0.14. Hence, in this range of q_He we find                                 
                                                                              
     absolute value[delta 2q_He] <= 3.5 x 10^-4  .                            
                                                                              
     We will denote with 3q_He the third term on the right-hand side of       
Equation (6). Again using the parameters of Table IV, one obtains             
                                                                              
     delta 3q_He = +- 5.7 x 10^-4 .                                           
                                                                              
     In this case, both delta Delta p_e and delta Delta T_e contribute about  
equally to the error sum. Unfortunately, it is not possible to actually       
measure the gas temperatures in the gas cells with the required accuracy      
(though the wall temperatures can be). We have to rely on the effectiveness of
the heat exchangers and continued intensive contact of the gas with the walls 
of the gas cells to maintain the required thermal equilibrium between the two 
gases.                                                                        
     As discussed in Section 4.2, we also have to include in the final        
estimate of the overall error delta q_He due to the effects of the chemical   
absorbers which introduce an uncertainty                                      
                                                                              
     delta aq_He = +- 5 x 10^-4 .                                             
                                                                              
     Adding quadratically the terms delta 2q_He, delta 3q_He, and delta aq_He 
we obtain the calculated overall error of the measured He mole fraction       
                                                                              
     delta q_He = +- 8 X 10^-4 .                                              
                                                                              
     This error still meets with our originally announced goal of an error    
smaller than +- 0.001 (von Zahn and Hoffmann, 1976), but it comes             
uncomfortably close to the latter. This is because during the instrument      
development phase the effects of the required chemical absorbers turned out to
be more significant than estimated. To be conservative we now prefer to state 
that our overall error on the helium mole fraction will eventually turn out to
be smaller than +- 0.0015.                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
                       4. Tests and Calibrations                              
                                                                              
4.1. TESTS                                                                    
                                                                              
     The instrument subsystems and critical components underwent an intensive 
series of developmental tests. The major objectives addressed in these tests  
were:                                                                         
                                                                              
- radiation hardening of selected components, in particular the IR emitting   
  diode and the photodiode array detector (Mett, 1980);                       
                                                                              
- overpressure testing of electronics components;                             
                                                                              
- temperature testing of critical electronics circuits;                       
                                                                              
- testing of the entrance burst diaphragm, opening device for the reference   
  gas, and of the membrane valve controlling the pressure differential between
  the Jovian and reference gas cells;                                         
                                                                              
- characterizing and quantifying the effectiveness of the absorbers employed  
  to remove H2O, NH3, and CH4 from the measured Jovian gas sample;            
                                                                              
- verification of a sufficient coherence length of the IR light source.       
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 5. Interference fringes caused by first filling the Jovian gas cell with 
N2 and then pumping it down, while the reference gas cell stays evacuated.    
Along the ordinate is shown the analog signal of the diode in the detector    
array, along the abscissa time (=No. of major frames of the telemetry). More  
than 50 fringes can be counted.                                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
     From the large number of individual test results we show in Figure 5 an  
example of a test for sufficient coherence length of the LED. This test is    
started by evacuating all gas cells of the interferometer. Then nitrogen is   
slowly introduced in the 'Jovian' gas cell(s) which causes a shift of the     
interference fringes at the detector. This shift is registered by the         
photodiodes. The analog signal from one of the 9 diodes is shown in Figure 5  
(along the ordinate). Along the abscissa, time is increasing (represented by  
the number of telemetry major frames). After counting 55 fringes the pressure 
rise is stopped and the nitrogen pumped out of the gas cell (with the final   
level of the diode signal matching nicely its initial level). As was noted    
above the maximum number of interference fringes to be counted during the     
descent into the Jovian atmosphere is 7. It follows that the bandwidth of the 
IF filter, and hence the coherence length of the LED assembly is chosen very  
conservatively and does not pose any limitations on the instrument            
performance.                                                                  
     The entire HAD instruments underwent the following tests according to    
specifications laid down in the document NASA JP-512.03 (1979):               
                                                                              
- temperature tests (in 1 bar of dry nitrogen);                               
                                                                              
- thermal-vacuum tests;                                                       
                                                                              
- high pressure tests;                                                        
                                                                              
- vibration tests (sine and random accelerations);                            
                                                                              
- acoustics tests;                                                            
                                                                              
- steady-state deceleration tests;                                            
                                                                              
- shock tests;                                                                
                                                                              
- electromagnetic interference tests.                                         
                                                                              
     The HAD engineering instrument was tested to design qualification levels,
the HAD flight instrument to the expected flight levels. During these tests   
the performance of the HAD optics gave, in general, only pleasant surprises.  
Before the design of the instrument could be successfully qualified, however, 
we were required to spend a considerable effort isolating the instrument from 
thermal and mechanical stresses induced by the mounting platform of the       
Galileo Probe on the interferometer. At the same time, it is obviously        
necessary to provide a rigid mounting for the HAD instrument inside the Probe 
in order for it to survive without harm the extreme mechanical loads          
experienced during its entry into the Jovian atmosphere.                      
     We might add that after all this elaborate testing and only a few weeks  
after 'final' delivery of the flight instrument to NASA for integration into  
the Galileo entry probe, the sensor PT, which measured the pressure of the    
reference gas in its storage vessel, started to leak. This event raised       
serious concerns about the reliability of this particular type of pressure    
sensor. Since there was no time to qualify and integrate a new type of        
pressure sensor, the leaky sensor was substituted by a dummy. This, in fact,  
ended our ability to monitor the pressure p_r in the storage vessel for the   
reference gas. As this quantity does not enter in the evaluation of the Jovian
helium abundance, no loss in accuracy of our results are expected from this   
mishaps.                                                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
4.2. CALIBRATIONS                                                             
                                                                              
     The HAD instrument carries 4 precision thermistors TS, TR, TC, and TF for
temperature measurements in the range from -25 degrees C to +40 degrees C.    
With the help of the following electronics the read-out from the sensors is   
made nearly linear between -10 degrees C and +15 degrees C, the range in which
the telemetry resolution is 0.2 degrees C (except for TF which measures the IR
filter temperature with a resolution of 0.8 degrees C). The absolute          
calibration of all four sensors is performed jointly to an accuracy of +-0.5  
degrees C. During the first checkout of the HAD instrument on its cruise      
towards Jupiter each of the TS, TR, and TC sensors read a temperature within  
the range of +7.20 degrees C +-0.12 degrees C. The spread of values is fully  
accounted for by the telemetry resolution.                                    
     The sensors PS and PR measure the pressures in the gas cells in the range
from 0 to 20 bar, while the sensor PD has 400 mbar full range. The absolute   
sensitivity of each sensor was calibrated against a rotating piston gage to   
within 0.1 percent of its reading, as was the temperature dependence of these 
sensitivities. It turned out that the temperature dependencies of the PS and  
PR sensors are negligible for our experiment. The temperature dependence of   
the PD sensor, however, needs to be taken into account in deriving the helium 
mole fraction. At an indicated pressure of 100 mbar it amounts to change of   
about 3 mbar in the temperature range from -30 degrees C to +35 degrees C.    
Accounting for this temperature dependence, the reproducibility of the        
pressure readings are within 1 mbar throughout the expected operating range of
the instrument.                                                               
     The spectral intensity distribution of the LED/filter combination was    
measured and the temperature shift of its centroid wavelength determined. The 
latter is                                                                     
                                                                              
     lambda (T) = (900.5 + 0.041 T) nm ,                                      
                                                                              
with T in degrees C. The temperature of the IR filter is measured by the      
sensor TF, but its value is obviously not critical.                           
     We tested a large number of absorber materials but unexpectedly could not
find one which absorbed methane efficiently, but did not absorb hydrogen. The 
effect of hydrogen absorption is not large, but measurable with the accuracy  
of our instrument. We measured this effect for many types of absorbers in a   
large number of descent simulation tests (see below). These were performed    
with the HAD instrument and covered the temperature range from -15 degrees C  
to +25 degrees C. We finally selected 1.3 g of silica gel as absorber for     
water and ammonia (absorber No. 1) and 1.15 g of activated carbon as absorber 
for methane (absorber No. 2). Additional tests using this absorber combination
quantified the required correction Delta aq_He of the measured helium mole    
fraction for gas mixtures having q_He in the range between 0.008 and 0.014.   
For a true He mole fraction q_He = 0.11 the correction is                     
                                                                              
     Delta aq_He = 4.0 x 10^-3 - 7.9 x 10^-5 T_a +- 5 x 10^-4  ,              
                                                                              
                                                                              
with T_a being the absorber temperature, again measured in degrees C. The     
quoted uncertainty of this correction term is to be taken independent of      
temperature and helium mole fraction in the tested ranges of those parameters.
     Verification of the value of 1q_He, the ratio of refractive index        
differences, has been discussed in Section 3.3. To this end a great number of 
laboratory simulations of the descent of the instrument into the Jovian       
atmosphere have been performed. These consisted of mounting the HAD instrument
in a high-pressure chamber in which the chamber pressure, the temperature of  
the mounting platform, and the temperature of the chamber gas could be        
programmed to follow the values expected during the actual Jovian descent.    
Many of these tests were performed with all of the burst diaphragms in place  
inside the HAD instrument, but in the majority of the tests no burst          
diaphragms were installed. For the development and calibration of HAD         
instruments, more than 500 such descent simulations were performed and        
evaluated.

   Figure 6 shows a typical result of a laboratory simulation of descent into 
the Jovian atmosphere (test No. 131), performed with the HAD flight instrument
equipped with burst membranes. The Jovian gas is simulated by a binary gas    
mixture of 11.08 percent He + rest H2. The solid line gives the helium mole   
fraction (V_He, in percent) calculated from the measured fringe motion. The   
abscissa gives the pressure p_s measured in the Jovian gas cell. After        
bursting the entrance diaphragm it rises comparatively rapidly. This is the   
reason why the data points, which are sampled at fixed time intervals, stretch
out for p_s <= 2.5 bar. The double lines near 10 bar indicate the exact helium
mole fraction (=0.1108) of the sampled gas with a 'permitted' measurement     
error of +-0.001. It is evident that the measured helium mole fraction (solid 
line) gives the correct result and does so well within the predicted          
uncertainty. The dotted line and right ordinate scale gives the temperature   
T_WT of simulated Jovian gas.                                                 
     Figure 7 shows a second example of such a descent simulation (test No.   
341). Here the HAD engineering instrument No. 2 is tested (without inlet burst
membranes). The Jovian gas is simulated by a mixture of 10.92 percent He,     
0.198 percent CH4, and the rest H2. Again, the solid line gives the helium    
mole fraction (V_He, in percent) calculated from the measured fringe motion   
and applying the correction for hydrogen absorption in the chemical absorbers.
The double lines near 10 bar indicate the exact helium mole fraction          
(=0.1092) of the sampled gas mixture with the 'permitted' measurement error of

again gives the correct result and does so well within the predicted          
uncertainty. As in Figure 6, the dotted line and right ordinate scale gives   
the temperature T_WT of simulated Jovian gas.

     We are most grateful to many of our colleagues and students for their    
diligent and untiring efforts on behalf of the HAD experiment. Over the years 
H. J. Hoffmann contributed heavily to the instrument development effort, W.   
Mett was responsible for radiation hardening of all the instrument subsystems,
W. Schulte developed the apparatus for laboratory simulations of the          
instrument descent into the Jovian atmosphere, and H. Schutze performed the   
calibration and environmental tests of the various units of the HAD           
instrument. Integration of the instrument into the spacecraft and systems     
tests were supported by H. Schutze and G. Lehmacher. K. Pelka assisted during 
various phases of the project through software development. The interferometer
part of the HAD instrument was developed by Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen), the other
portion of the HAD by Messerschmitt - Bolkow - Blohm (Ottobrunn). This        
experiment was supported by the Bundesministerium fur Forschung und           
Technologie, Bonn, Germany through grant WRK 01 QJ 1070.
