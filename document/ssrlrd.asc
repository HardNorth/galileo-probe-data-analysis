Abstract. The Lightning and Radio Emission Detector (LRD) instrument will be  
carried by the Galileo Probe into Jupiter's atmosphere. The LRD will verify   
the existence of lightning in the atmosphere and will determine the details of
many of its basic characteristics. The instrument, operated in its            
magnetospheric mode at distances of about 5, 4, 3, and 2 planetary radii from 
Jupiter's center, will also measure the radio frequency (RF) noise spectrum in
Jupiter's magnetosphere. The LRD instrument is composed of a ferrite-core     
radio frequency antenna (~100 Hz to ~100 kHz) and two photodiodes mounted     
behind individual fisheye lenses. The output of the RF antenna is analyzed    
both separately and in coincidence with the optical signals from the          
photodiodes. The RF antenna provides data both in the frequency domain (with  
three narrow-band channels, primarily for deducing the physical properties of 
distant lightning) and in the time domain with a priority scheme (primarily   
for determining from individual RF waveforms the physical properties of       
closeby-lightning).                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
1. Introduction                                                               
                                                                              
   Prior to the Voyager 1 flyby of Jupiter, the presence of lightning in that 
planet's atmosphere had been speculatively suggested as an energy source both 
for the non-thermal radio emissions from the planet (which are easily         
detectable at Earth) and for the production of certain nonequilibrium chemical
species. The suggestion regarding nonthermal radio emissions was soon         
effectively dismissed by the work of several researchers, in particular       
Zheleznyakov (1970). However, the second suggestion, related to possible      
non-equilibrium chemical processes, may well have some validity (Sagan et     
al., 1967; Woeller and Ponnamperuma, 1969; Chadha et al., 1971; Bar-Nun,      
1975; Bar-Nun et al., 1984; Bar-Nun and Podolak, 1985; Prinn and Owen, 1976). 
In spite of the uncertainty prior to the Voyager 1 encounter regarding the    
existence of lightning on Jupiter, NASA believed the question of Jovian       
lightning to be of sufficient importance that a joint U. S.-German lightning  
experiment was selected for flight on the Galileo Probe (Lanzerotti et al.,   
1983).                                                                        
                                                                              
   The Voyager 1 mission produced two night-side photographs showing strong   
optical evidence for lightning in Jupiter's atmosphere (Cook et al., 1979;    
Borucki et al., 1982). Data from Voyager's plasma wave experiment (PWS) show  
the existence of whistler waves, most probably generated by lightning         
discharges, propagating in Jupiter's magnetosphere (Gurnett et al., 1979;     
Kurth et al., 1985). However, these observations cannot provide information on
several key parameters related to possible Jovian lightning (e.g., frequency  
of occurrence, intensity, distribution, global distribution, source height    
distribution, cloud charging, and discharging). Hence, measurements of        
lightning in situ in the Jovian atmosphere are crucial to understanding some  
of the electrical properties, as well as the chemistry and dynamics, of this  
giant planet's atmosphere.                                                    
                                                                              
   Because of the possible existence of lightning on Venus (e.g.,             
Ksanfomality, 1979; Taylor et al., 1979) and Saturn (e.g., Kaiser et al.,     
1983; Burns et al., 1983; Zarka, 1985), as well as on Jupiter, there has      
emerged a new field of research that could be called planetary lightning.     
Several reviews of planetary lightning have already been written (Levin et    
al., 1983; Williams et al., 1983; Rinnert, 1982, 1985; Lanzerotti et al.,     
1988a, 1989a) and a book chapter devoted to the subject is contained in a     
recent monograph on the lightning discharge (Uman, 1987). At least one thesis 
already exists on Jovian lightning (Williams, 1986).                          
                                                                              
   The LRD instrument has been designed to take into account large            
uncertainties in the nature of possible Jovian lightning. For example, since  
Jupiter has no well-defined surface close to the cloud system, there will be  
no cloud-to-ground discharges, which are the best understood type of lightning
on Earth. Lightning in general, and cloud discharges specifically, are very   
complex physical phenomena and can generate a large variety of RF pulse types 
and trains: unipolar pulses, bipolar pulses, asymmetric pulses, groups and    
bursts of pulses. The LRD instrument is designed as a compact and versatile   
instrument which allows a characterization of these signals with maximum      
sensitivity and maximum dynamic range. During the design phase, prototype     
instruments have been intensively tested with Earth lightning during several  
measuring campaigns. The final instrument characteristics have been set with  
acceptable margins for the unknown conditions to Jupiter.                     
                                                                              
   Modelling of the propagation of RF signals in the frequency range of the   
LRD instrument in Jupiter's atmosphere shows that direct propagation of       
signals will occur to distances of order 10^4 km (Rinnert et al., 1979).      
Hence, it is likely that Jovian atmospheric discharges with the energy of a   
typical cloud-to-ground discharge on Earth (order 10^8 J) will be detected at 
10^4 km or more distance within the atmosphere with the LRD instrument. As    
noted below, the LRD instrument also includes a 'superbolt' channel, in order 
to count extremely large events.                                              
                                                                              
   Hence, in light of all the above, the flown lightning detector instrument  
must be designed to be as sensitive as possible, limited only by spacecraft   
noise. The instrument must also cover as large a dynamic range as possible.   
                                                                              
2. Cloud Structure and Lightning                                              
                                                                              
   Most Earth lightning is produced by the charge generated and separated in  
cumulo nimbus clouds that develop in unstable air containing water vapor (see,
for example, the reviews in Uman, 1987). The instability is most often        
produced by solar heating at the ground or by the interaction of air masses   
driven together by winds and convection.  As the moist air rises and cools,   
condensation occurs and ultimately precipitation forms. Charging of particles 
in the air can occur by various processes, including a thermoelectric effect  
and collisions between water droplets, supercooled water, and ice in various  
forms. On Earth, it is thought that the positive charges are predominant on   
the smaller particles and are raised preferentially by vertical convective    
motion. In Earth's atmosphere, charges can be separated to distances of the   
order of kilometers. Most lightning discharges in the Earth's atmosphere occur
as intracloud lightning and neutralize tens of Coulombs of charge.  Cloud-to- 
ground lightning generally transfers negative charge from the lower portion of
the cloud to the Earth's surface.                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 1. Temperature, altitude, and pressure in the Jovian cloud system as     
given by the model of Weidenschilling and Lewis (1973).  The water ice cloud  
for a depleted water abundance (10^-3 solar abundance) at Jupiter is also     
shown (adapted from Atreya, 1986).  At the top is a cartoon schematic of the  
global atmospheric convective motion.                                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
   A sketch of the temperature-density-altitude-pressure profile of the Jovian
atmosphere is shown in Figure 1, based upon the cloud model of Weldenschilling
and Lewis (1973). The height region for a water ice cloud for an atmospheric  
mixing ratio 10^-3 that of the solar abundance is indicated by the hatched    
area (Atreya, 1986). At the top of Figure 1, the global convection motions in 
the Jovian system are indicated schematically.                                
                                                                              
   The cloud model in the lower portion of Figure 1 assumes stationary        
atmospheric conditions, solar composition, and chemistry in thermal           
equilibrium (i.e., no sources such as lightning to change energy from any     
existent electromagnetic fields to sound, heat, RF, etc.). More recent cloud  
models, deduced primarily from spacecraft optical measurements, contain either
no, or only a thin, NH4SH cloud, and add aerosol layers to account for the    
haze seen above the ammonia clouds (Sato and Hansen, 1979; West and Tomasko,  
1980; Marten et al., 1981; Orton et al., 1982; Owen and Terrile, 1982).       
Further, Bjoraker et al. (1986) deduced from Voyager infrared interferometer  
spectrometer (IRIS) measurements at 5 mm that water is depleted by a factor of
~50 relative to solar abundances in the 2-6 bar atmosphere region.            
                                                                              
   With the type of atmosphere illustrated in Figure 1, a cartoon comparison  
can be made of Earth's and Jupiter's cloud structures, as is done in Figure 2.

Fig. 2.  Cartoon representation of the possible locations of separated charges
in the atmospheres of Earth and Jupiter, showing comparisons of the cloud     
locations, altitudes, and temperatures.                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
atmospheric chemical species in each planet's atmosphere are boxed. On Earth, 
the topography of the land surface can at times also determine cloud location 
for the separated charges. Obviously, such an orographical influence should   
not exist at Jupiter, and the lightning should primarily be of the            
intra-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-'air' types.                        
                                                                              
   Especially important for establishing the conditions for localized,        
intense, upward convective motions in the Jovian atmosphere has been the      
recent modeling work of Stoker (1986) to understand the vertical structure of 
the equatorial plumes. She finds that, for appropriate parameters for cumulus 
cloud formation, moist convection can produce the equatorial plumes. For a    
solar water abundance in the atmosphere, peak vertical convective velocities  
of ~150 m s^-1 are found.                                                     
                                                                              
   The model results of Stoker (1986) suggest that the water abundance is     
closer to solar than to the depleted water conditions suggested by Bjoraker et
al. (1986). Lunine and Hunten (1987) use the idea of moist convective plumes  
and the model plume of Stoker (1986) to conclude that such plumes can explain 
the apparent depletion of the IRIS detected water vapor on Jupiter without    
invoking a global depletion of water from solar abundance. It is interesting  
to note that neither Stoker (1986) nor Lunine and Hunten (1987) made mention  
of the possibility of lightning production in convective regions such as these
plumes, even though atmospheric conditions in the models, such as aerosols and
upward convective velocities, are present to produce electrical charge        
separations and discharges (e.g., Williams et al., 1983; Levin et al., 1983).

the locations in the magnetosphere of LRD data acquisition.                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
3. Overview of LRD Objectives                                                 
                                                                              
   As illustrated schematically in Figure 3, the Galileo Probe will be        
released from the Orbiter spacecraft 150 days prior to atmospheric entry.     
Radio frequency measurements are made in a reduced mode of operation at       
altitudes of ~5, 4, 3, 2 planetary radii from the center of Jupiter. These    
data are stored in the Probe memory and then read out during the atmospheric  
descent phase of the mission. During the atmospheric descent, the full        
complement of LRD data are acquired until the loss of the Probe signal by the 
over-flying Orbiter and/or the demise of the Probe due to atmospheric pressure
and heat.                                                                     
                                                                              
   The science objectives of the LRD instrument are shown in Figure 4 for both
magnetosphere and the atmosphere measurements. Measurements will not be made  
in the Jovian ionosphere (schematically shown by the horizontal dashed line). 
The RF data obtained in the magnetosphere will be analyzed also jointly with  
the Probe Energetic Particle Instrument (EPI) data to gain understanding of   
magnetospheric particle dynamics. In the magnetosphere, statistics on the     
characteristics of individual waveforms measured during a sampling interval   
will be accumulated at the four different altitudes. In addition, noise levels
at three different spectral frequencies (3, 5, 90 kHz) will be determined     
during the measurement intervals.                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 4.  Science objectives of the LRD instrument.                            
                                                                              
   In the atmosphere mode, in addition to statistics on the waveforms and the 
spectral noise levels at the three narrow-banded frequencies, individual      
waveforms will be detected, saved, and transmitted to Earth. Such waveforms   
will provide powerful additional diagnostic capabilities for Jovian RF        
signals.                                                                      
                                                                              
   The LRD instrument, as noted above, has been designed to be as sensitive as
possible, limited only by the spacecraft noise, and to be as versatile as     
possible, limited only by the imposed limitations on power, bit rate, and     
reliability considerations. It is within these constraints that the scientific
objectives (Figure 4) will attempt to be achieved. Extensive measurements with
Earth lightning have been made (see below) and these will be continued in     
order to gain the maximum understanding of the operational characteristics of 
the instrument, and therefore the maximum science from the Probe descent      
through Jupiter's atmosphere.

LRD instrument.                                                               
                                                                              
   In both the magnetosphere and atmosphere modes the component of the Jovian 
magnetic field perpendicular to the Probe spin axis will be determined. These 
data will be used for analyses of EPI data and for determining the spatial    
distribution of the sources of some of the detected lightning signals.        
Further, these data will give engineering data on the Probe spin rate.        
                                                                              
   The output data from the LRD instrument is schematically shown with the two
sensor types in Figure 5. The single ferrite core antenna ('magnetic sensor', 
MS) and two optical sensors (OS1; OS2) are shown. The optical sensors provide 
the optical (OPT) signals. The MS provides the input signal for the three     
principal RF data channels: the waveform analyzer (WFA) for statistics and    
waveform snapshot, the spectrum analyzer (SPA) with the three narrow-banded   
frequencies F1, F2, F3, and the magnetic field/spin rate determination B0E.

   Radio wave sensor. The elements of the RF sensor are pictured in Figure 7. 
The RF signals in the Jovian atmosphere in the frequency range ~100 Hz to ~100
kHz are detected using the 32 cm long ferrite core antenna (Dehmel, 1989). An 
electric antenna is not used because of expected electrostatic noise during   
Probe descent through the Jovian atmosphere. The MS is mounted in a plane     
perpendicular to the spin axis of the Probe. As the Probe rotates with a      
nominal 10 rpm rate, a relatively high voltage is induced due to the strong   
Jupiter magnetic field (~4 G). This signal has to be suppressed and, in       
effect defines the lower band limit. The upper band limit was set to 100 kHz  
according to the sampling frequency of the signal (see below) and in order to 
suppress the detection of any high-frequency noise generated in the Jovian    
magnetosphere which can penetrate the Jovian ionosphere at frequencies higher 
than its maximum critical frequency.                                          
                                                                              
   The antenna is mounted outside the Probe body and is thus subject to large 
ambient temperature changes: from about 0 degrees C during cruise, to -150    
degrees C after heat shield release, to +150 degrees C during descent. The    
strong ferrite core support structure is filled with insulating ceramic       
material to smooth this temperature variation. The antenna is wrapped in a    
conducting fabric as a shield for high-frequency stray fields from the nearby 
telemetry antenna. The antenna also contains a low-noise preamplifier with a  
dynamic range of 80 dB.                                                       
                                                                              
   The LRD instrument performs its magnetospheric measurements when the Probe 
is encapsuled in the Probe heat shield. Hence, the after heat shield cover was
designed with a special RF window over the antenna location. All of the       
thermal and structural

right: Piece of ferrite rod, coil, electronics, support structure, mounted    
antenna filled and enveloped with thermal isolation. (Not shown: outer-most   
cover of microwave absorbing material.) The dimensions of the assembled       
antenna shown on right are 32 cm long by 3.3 cm diameter.                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
loads, as well as the electromagnetic responses with and without the heat     
shield, including operation with the Probe telemetry, have been extensively   
tested during the development and fabrication program.                        
                                                                              
   Optical sensors. For an unambiguous verification of lightning as the source
of measured magnetic pulses, a coincidence with light pulses is important. For
this purpose, two identical sensors are mounted to look in opposite directions
about the perpendicular to the Probe spin axis. Each sensor consists of a     
photodiode with an amplifier behind a fisheye lens. Both sensors are sensitive
to the visual spectrum and together cover nearly a full 4*pi field of view.   
Special care has been taken to thermally decouple the lenses (exposed to the  
ambient temperature) and the electronics (which are coupled to the Probe      
structure). The signals of both sensors are added and provide measurements of 
the overall atmospheric brightness and of the light pulses (Figure 4).

   Electronics. Figure 8 gives an overview of the analog and digital          
electronics and the signal paths of the sensor outputs. Four major            
sub-elements of the electronics are indicated by the dashed boxes and are     
described below.                                                              
                                                                              
   B0E: The voltage induced due to the rotation of the antenna within the     
Jovian magnetic field provides a measure of the magnitude of the magnetic     
field component perpendicular to the Probe spin axis and of the Probe spin    
period. This signal is also used to sector RF measurements with respect to the
ambient magnetic field direction.                                             
                                                                              
   SPA: The SPectral Analyzer consists of three narrow-band frequency channels
centered at 3, 15, and 90 kHz. In each of the three channels the rectified and
averaged signal is output as a measure of the narrow-band noise level, and a  
pulse height analyzer measures the amplitude distribution with 8 amplitude    
levels spaced by 10 dB. One of the narrow-band channels is sectored using the 
spin phase information of B0E. During the Pre-Entry (magnetosphere) mode of   
Operation (see below) the 3 kHz-channel is subdivided into two channels:      
parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. During the Descent mode of  
operation the 15 kHz channels is subdivided into 4 channels. This is the most 
'sensitive' portion of the instrument. For example, an 'average' Earth        
lightning at a distance ~20 km could trigger a threshold ~60 dB above the     
present Probe noise level (see Rinnert et al. (1979) for discussions of       
propagation conditions in Jupiter's atmosphere).                              
                                                                              
   WFA: The Wave Form Analyzer uses the full antenna bandwidth. Since the     
output signal of the magnetic antenna is proportional to the time derivative  
of the magnetic wave field, the antenna output first is integrated to regain  
the correct waveform.  This signal is then fed to a gain change amplifier and 
is continuously digitized every 4 ms to provide the input for the waveform    
snapshot (see below). The integrated signal is amplified, rectified and       
averaged to provide the wideband signal noise levels and to obtain statistical
characteristics of the waveforms. There are four threshold levels spaced by 10
dB following a gain change amplifier (0, 10, 20, 30 dB). Signals exceeding the
lower threshold are treated as events and are characterized by the highest    
threshold which is exceeded and by the duration between consecutive crossings 
of the lower threshold, which corresponds to either a 'pulse duration time' or
a 'pulse gap time'. As noted, there are 4 amplitude levels; the duration times
and the gap times are sorted into 8 time bins for each distribution:

                 266-522 micros                72.2-1100 ms

   The gain change amplifier adjusts the pulse height analyzer to the         
appropriate noise level as it is controlled by the number of events in order  
to guarantee that pulses are characterized which sufficiently exceed the      
background noise level.  A bipolar pulse, for example, is characterized by two
amplitudes, two duration times (one for each half period) and one gaptime     
between the threshold crossings of the two half periods. Another channel is   
devoted to extremely large events, so-called 'super bolts' (see Figure 5). The
threshold of this channel is set 20 dB above the highest WFA threshold.       
                                                                              
   OPT:  The OPTical channel adds the output signals of both optical          
detectors. An averaged d.c. signal from the combined detectors provides a     
measure of the 'brightness' of the Probe's atmospheric environment. The pulses
from the combined signals correspond to flashes. There is no information on   
the optical spectrum, the pulse amplitude or other pulse characteristics.     
                                                                              
   Not shown in Figure 2 is the In Flight Testgenerator (IFT). This device    
inserts 128 well-defined electrical pulses into the electronics in place of   
the MS signals. These pulses are processed the same way as the antenna signals
and give test data on the operation of the instrument.                        
                                                                              
   WF SNAPSHOT: The Wave Form Snapshot channel provides a window of 1 ms out  
of the continuously sampled signal (sample period 4 micros). A block diagram  
of the WF Snapshot electronics is shown in Figure 9. The peak amplitude of the
measured pulse defines the trigger point. The 1 ms signal interval contains 64
pre-trigger samples covering 256 micros before the pulse peak, 64 post-trigger
samples covering 256 micros after the pulse peak, and 61 samples (every second
sample) covering 488 micros. The time resolution of the first half of the time
interval is therefore 4 micros and the second half is 8 micros. Although      
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 9.  Block diagram of the waveform 'snapshot' analyzer of the LRD         
instrument.                                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
the antenna signal is continuously sampled, only one one-millisecond interval 
is saved for transmission during each measuring period of 256 s. This is      
because of the limited data rate available for the instrument. Two switched   
pipeline memories are used for this purpose. The signal interval that is      
transmitted during each measuring interval (see below) is defined by a        
rotating priority scheme (largest amplitude waveform with optical coincidence;
largest amplitude waveform; and random).                                      
                                                                              
   The instrument is controlled by an 1802 microprocessor which determines the
modes of operation (including the EPI measurements), generates the statistical
distributions, determines coincidences between optical and magnetic pulses and
performs the data formatting (most of the science data are logarithmically    
compressed). One standard data frame consists of 256 bytes in total and       
contains the information gathered during four major frame periods of 64 s     
each. The first one quarter (64 bytes) of the LRD science data frame contains 
all of the LRD statistics information (spectral and waveform statistics),     
number of events, average levels, and gain information. The other three       
quarters (192 bytes) of the data frame contain the waveform samples as signed 
numbers (-128 to +127) and waveform status information. The second and        
third quarters of the LRD science data frame contain the values of the samples
which are made each 4 micros, while the fourth quarter contains the values of 
those samples which are each 8 micros. In addition, the data frame contains   
engineering data such as voltages, currents, and temperatures.

at distances from the planet's center of about 5, 4, 3, and 2 Rj. The         
instrument is switched on by the Probe timer at these locations. In this      
'magnetosphere mode' the EPI is also in operation. As the Probe is still      
encapsulated within the heat shield, the MS is less sensitive and the optical 
sensors are covered. The outputs of the LRD instrument are as noted in the    
previous section, but without the waveform snapshots. The magnetosphere mode  
data set at each of the four locations consists of a 64 byte data frame with  
statistics and the 3 kHz spectral channel subdivided into parallel and        
perpendicular (to the magnetic field) channels. The data are stored in the    
Probe memory for transmission during the atmospheric descent phase of the     
mission.                                                                      
                                                                              
   Atmosphere mode. When the LRD instrument is switched on at descent the     
instrument begins with a test cycle (IFT) and the first data set contains the 
test pulse data. After that, the instrument runs continuously until the end of
the mission and outputs a complete data set every four major frame periods,   
256 s. These data sets contain spectral data (the 15 kHz channel being        
sectored), waveform statistics data, a 1 ms time interval with a selected     
waveform, optical data and miscellaneous data such as magnetic field          
component, spin period, and engineering data. The number of complete data sets
achieved during descent depends upon the length of time that the Probe        
survives and/or the length of time that the Probe relay signal is successfully
acquired by the over-flying Orbiter. For example, if the total atmosphere data
time is ~48 min, then 10 data sets would be sent back (the 11th would be      
acquired but there would be no time for transmittal). The 10 data sets would  
contain one test data set and 9 science data sets.                            
                                                                              
6. Tests and Calibrations                                                     
                                                                              
   Because of severe constraints as to weight and power for Probe subsystems, 
the LRD instrument is very compact. Further, extensive on-board compression of
the data is necessary because of the limited available data rate.             
                                                                              
   All sensors and instrument characteristics, of course, have been           
extensively tested and calibrated. For example, radiation tests were carried  
out on the sensor electronics and pressure tests were made of the vented      
electronics box. These latter tests caused a stiffening piece to be added to  
the microprocessor chip. The calibrations could be verified over long periods 
because of the delays of the launch of the Galileo spacecraft.  A further     
verification of the instrument parameters is provided by the on-board         
implemented test generator (ITG), as noted in Section 4.

   Most important for the definition, design verification, and test of the    
instrument have been the extensive campaigns devoted to measurements of Earth 
lightning. Some of the results of these campaigns and their relevance to both 
characterizing the instrument and to providing new data on Earth lightning    
have been reported in the scientific literature over the years (Rinnert et    
al., 1984, 1985, 1988, 1989; Lanzerotti et al., 1988b; 1989b).                
On Earth, cloud-to-ground discharges are quite different in their RF          
characteristics                                                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 11.  Examples of types of intra-cloud discharge magnetic field waveforms 
measured in Lindau during three different lightning storms.                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
than are intra-cloud discharges. These differences are being carefully studied
by our team using the LRD engineering unit (which has identical electrical    
characteristics to the instrument flying on the Probe). These studies are     
being made in order to eventually be able to evaluate the atmospheric         
breakdown processes, the electrical currents, and the possible chemical       
processes associated with Jovian lightning.                                   
                                                                              
   As an example, shown in the upper portions of both sides of Figure 10 are  
the magnetic field wave forms of two cloud-to-ground return strokes measured  
in Lindau with the Galileo LRD engineering instrument unit during a nearby    
lightning storm in 1984. The power spectrum of the RF signals for each of     
these discharges was calculated for us by D. J. Thomson (AT&T Bell            
Laboratories) after first mathematically removing the impulse response of each
signal. The power spectra were then calculated using four prolate spheroidal  
data windows in the time domain and a fast Fourier transform algorithm (see   
Lanzerotti et al., 1989b). Each RF power spectrum clearly falls with          
increasing frequency and each spectrum has definite structure that corresponds
to the 'secondary peaks' evident in the time domain traces following the      
initial impulse.                                                              
                                                                              
   The RF signals of intra-cloud Earth lightning discharges have been much    
less studied than those of cloud-to-ground discharges (see, e.g., Uman, 1987).
On average, ground discharges are much more powerful than cloud discharges.   
The ratios of the amplitudes of return strokes to cloud discharges appear to  
range from about 20 to 1 at ~3 kHz, to ~10 to 1 at 10 kHz, to ~1 to 1 at 100  
kHz (Brook and Ogawa, 1977). Shown in Figure 11 are examples of different     
types of magnetic field waveforms produced by cloud discharges and measured   
using the engineering unit (Lanzerotti et al., 1989b). From top               
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Fig. 12.  The gap time distribution provided by the LRD instrument during two 
lightning storm intervals.                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
to bottom in the figure, the cloud discharges observed in 1 ms include a      
single bipolar pulse, a series of quasi-periodic bipolar pulses filling the   
entire measuring interval, and a sequence of (possibly approximately periodic)
bipolar pulses apparently modulated by an overall signal envelope.            
                                                                              
   LRD analysis of the intervals between pulses (gap times) obtained during   
two storm periods is shown in Figure 12 (Rinnert et al., 1989). The large     
numbers of gap times less than 8 micros are probably due to the gaps between  
successive portions of rectified bipolar pulses. There is a significant       
minimum in gap times between 56 and 88 micros, and then a maximum for gap     
times between ~10 and ~170 ms. Additional studies have been made on Earth     
lightning with the LRD engineering unit to study gap time and other           
distributions as a function of whether the originating RF signals were        
predominantly intra-cloud or cloud-to-ground (Rinnert et al., 1989). The field
campaigns with the LRD instrument have yielded interesting new scientific     
results in the discipline of lightning research. Such studies will be         
continued in the years to come until the Probe descends through the Jovian    
atmosphere in December 1995.
