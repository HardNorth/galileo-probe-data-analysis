An error was discovered in the NMS RATIOS.TAB data. The deepest water         
abundance was off by an order of magnitude. The correct line should read:     
H2O (19 bar)     <= (6+-3)x10-4     <= (5.2+-2.6)x10-4 <= 0.35                
This has been corrected on the online version and on all subsequent CDs which 
will be labeled Version 3 in VOLDESC.CAT.                                     
                                                                              
The LRD data are not likely to be recovered from the instrument team due to   
the recent death of one of the Co-Investigators. We are hoping to be able to  
generate a supplementary data set in the future.                              
                                                                              
The HAD instrument team submitted only their reduced data. No raw data or     
calibration data was submitted. See [VONZAHN&HUNTEN1992], [VONZAHN&HUNTEN1996]
and [VONZAHNETAL1998] for details of the instrument and results.              
                                                                              
The EPI instrument team submitted only their raw data. No reduced data or     
calibration data were submitted. See [FISCHERETAL1980], [FISCHERETAL1992] and 
[FISCHERETAL1996] for details of the instrument and results.                  
                                                                              
Catalog files for ASI, NEP and HAD were not submitted by the instrument teams 
and were generated by the PDS Atmospheres Node.
