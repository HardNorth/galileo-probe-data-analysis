     VOLINDEX.LBL - A PDS label describing the index table which already      
                contains pointers to the data table, so no further steps are  
                required to make it accessible to PDS table-processing        
                software.                                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
     VOLINDEX.TAB - An ASCII table containing the index information. Each line
                ends with the characters <CR><LF> (ASCII 13 and 10            
                respectively). All fields in the tables are fixed width.      
                The fields are as follows:                                    
                    Path to the given file, in UNIX format                    
                    Name of the data file                                     
                    Original file name if known

                    Product Creation Time                                     
                    Number of bytes in a single data record                   
                    Number of records in the file
